Following Iraqi army’s recapture of Mosul from IS, which brought to light the extremist organisation’s weakened state and loss of territory, the question of the group’s very existence has come to the fore
 It would appear that a project aiming to establish and maintain a ‘caliphate’ straddling the Iraqi-Syrian border will buckle under the international coalition’s bombing campaign. That is not to say that it will be destroyed – the withdrawal of its fighters to Raqqa, IS’ ‘capital’ in Syria, proves its desire to continue to fight to achieve its objectives.Since 2014, when it took Mosul, IS has made use of its considerable financial means to invest in infrastructure
 Considered the world’s richest terrorist organisation, the group’s wealth allows it to control territories acquired by force, allowing it to pursue its expansionist agenda. Unlike previous organisations such as al-Qaeda, the group has been able to establish a ‘state’. IS’ territory provides it with access to natural resources such as oil, wheat and cotton, the sale of which is achieved through longstanding smuggling networks including illegal trafficking in antiquities.Yet, to pursue its project, a group such as IS needs funding to continue to exist and attract young would-be members
 But its sources of funding have considerably decreased across the board, whether because of the oil income lost through the bombing of oil wells and the drop in oil prices, reduced revenues from taxes levied on an increasingly destitute local population, or due to measures taken by the international community to hinder its financing. These various factors have the additional effect of hampering financial transfers and donations. Lastly, IS’ finances will be hurt by the loss of Mosul, the organisation’s ‘commercial capital’.The international community has an essential role to play in the fight against IS, a cause the United Nations and most of its constituent countries have taken up ever since it took stock of the danger the group posed not only to local populations, but to those struck by attacks perpetrated beyond the Middle East
IS’ decreased resources could compel it to demand that its followers strike their home turf, whether Europe, Turkey or Lebanon
 These operations can be carried out with limited resources while having a considerable effect on public opinion.The United Nations has established a binary mechanism to counter the financing of terrorism, the first under the authority of the Security Council and the second under the General Assembly
 Since 1999, the UN has takenup the issue of private contributors through the Security Council through resolutions and pertaining to IS, al-Qaeda’s network and the persons, groups, companies and various bodies that are linked to the two groups
 The aforementioned resolutions also foresee the implementation of sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).The European Union is also active in the fight against IS, especially in terms of adopting measures aiming to sever the terrorists’ financial networks
 The circulation of cash and the transfer of funds are both heavily regulated in order to increase the traceability of financial flows, all the while keeping an eye on digital platforms through which virtual currency can be exchanged.The Member States, taken individually, have a major responsibility to implement and enforce common decisions
  In this respect, the  European  Parliament  could  request information  on the different levels of commitment and progress Member States have realised in the fight against terrorism and, notably, efforts made to stem IS’ financing. It is evident that Member States cannot all muster the same level of engagement given their varying financial means, as well as the differing historical development of their administrations and police forces. However, it remains possible to build a common foundation, not only supported by EU institutions, but by those Member States that are most developed.The European Parliament could also request an annual reporting mechanism regarding the measures taken by the various Member States and the Commission pertaining to the fight against the funding of terrorism
