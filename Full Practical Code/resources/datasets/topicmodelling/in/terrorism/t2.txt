At its largest, IS’ controlled territory straddling two countries, Syria and Iraq, stretched from north to south, from Palmyra to the Turkish border, and from east to west, starting as far East as Kobane (known as Ayn al- Arab before the conflict)
IS fills an ever-increasing vacuum in these two failed states, which explains the ease with which it was able to implant itself first in Iraq, then in Syria 
Qaeda, differing insofar as it managed to anchor itself territorially
 Indeed, following its creation in the mountains of Peshawar by Osama bin Laden in 1988, al-Qaeda, ‘the base’ in Arabic, did not seek to implant itself geographically. Instead, the organisation strove to attack the ‘far enemy’, that is ‘the United States, Zionists and crusaders’. Attacks were consequently launched against the American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya (1998), the American destroyer USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden (2000), followed by that of 9/11. Osama bin Laden, born into a Saudi family with Yemeni roots, funded such operations through his personal fortune.While the 9/11 attack gave al-Qaeda an international audience, it was not able to launch any further attacks on such a large scale
 This led to jihadi ideologues such as Abu Musab al-Suri2  calling the organisation’s strategy into question, arguing that the focus should be on carrying out attacks on European soil, where large Muslim communities lived. Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi, founder of al-Qaeda, followed by its current leader al-Baghdadi, have both cited al-Suri’s doctrines. The organisation also distinguished itself by targeting Shiite Muslims. Its aim was to create clandestine, isolated cells overseen by a centralised command structure in order to prevent their detection. Gilles Kepel called this the restructured, ‘grassroots’ jihad,which he described as 	nizam la tanzim	 (a system and not an organisation) while adding: ‘al-Suri uploaded, in January 2005, his book ‘The Global Islamic Resistance Call’ which described Europe as targeted by a form of grassroots jihad whose foot soldiers would be recruited from the ranks of 45 million European Muslims’
Such theoreticians recognised that a form of  ‘shock-and-awe’  terrorism,  engaging in tactics of mass destruction, had become impossible
 They thus strove to play their enemies off against each other, creating a societal rift between the local population and Muslims in order to incite them to leave the country in which they resided and make their way to lands where they could live in harmony with Islam’s precepts.IS’ project aims to establish a caliphate within which the world’s Muslims can settle
 Its objective is to establish such a caliphate on territory from which it can wage an international jihad. This project thus differs from al-Qaeda’s and was first implemented in Iraq, due to the country’s profound destabilisation as a result of successive foreign military interventions. The last such intervention, in 2003, ravaged the country. IS continued by expanding into Syria, taking advantage of Bashar al-Assad’s lack of control over the entirety of his territory, to establish its ‘capital’ as Raqqa.Another element must be considered in order to better understand IS’ expansion and its ability to attract numerous individuals into its ranks
 Unlike al-Qaeda, which is fundamentally elitist in nature, IS is a ‘catch- all’ organisation which recruits also those who are inexperienced, naïve and unwitting as well as many women as possible. Following the American intervention in Iraq and the implementation of a political project aiming to achieve a better representation of Iraqis within the political sphere, the Shiite majority, long  suppressed  by  the  Sunni  minority  under  Saddam  Hussein, took  power.  The  Sunnis were  thus marginalised, excluded from the political process by a vengeful minority that had been relegated to the side-lines for decades. Spurred by their total exclusion from the political sphere, a number of Sunnis began to gravitate towards Salafist movements, despite a period in which they hoped to have their voice heard.Even this period, known as the 	Sahwa (‘awakening’) tribal movement of 2007-2008, was but a flash in the pan3 
As a result, IS’ structure is particularly hybridised
