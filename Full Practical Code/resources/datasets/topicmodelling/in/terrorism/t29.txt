"56) Imminence classically depended on timing.Only when an attack is soon to occur, and thus certain, can a nation use force in pre-emptive self-defense
 What about the magnitude of harmposed by a threatened attack? According to conventional doctrine, a nation must wait until an attack is imminent before using force, whether the attack is launched by a small band of cross-border rebels, as in the Caroline affair, or by a terrorist organization armed with biological or chemical weapons
Terrorist groups today can launch a sudden attack with weapons of devastating magnitude
 To save lives, it is now necessary to use forceearlier and more selectively
Imminence as a concept also fails to deal with covert activity
 Terroristsdeliberately disguise themselves as civilians
 Their organizations have no
 territory or populations to defend, and they attack by surprise. This makesit virtually impossible to use force in self-defense once an attack is "imminent
" There is no target to attack in the form of the army of a nationstate.The best defense will be available only during a small window of opportunity when terrorist leaders become visible to the military or intelligence agencies
