 On the one hand, the organisation’s Iraqi component is largely made up of ex-soldiers who had served under Saddam Hussein and then fought against the Shiite- dominated power-centre in Baghdad, as well as of Sunni tribes which had been discriminated against by the Shiite elite. On the other, it is composed of universalist jihadists5  from the al-Zarqawi school (who have a greater presence in Syria), embodied by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi6 . Also going by either his real name, Ibrahim Awad Ali al-Badri, as well as such monikers as al-Husseini and al-Qurashi, or even Caliph Ibrahim among his supporters, he was born in 1971 in Iraq. He is said to have become radicalised during the American invasion of Iraq, having been subsequently imprisoned. He rubbed shoulders with al-Qaeda leaders during his incarceration, joining Islamic State of Iraq when the organisation was founded in 2006. He became leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq in 2010 but ended up by breaking ties with the organisation’s leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, by refusing to pledge allegiance to him. He declared the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in 2014.IS’ existence, as well as its ability to mobilise, concerns the Sunni community’s representation
 Who can now represent it in Iraq ? Pressure has built up to a point where IS’ internal priorities have shifted from state building to military engagements
  In May 2016, through its spokesperson 	Abu Mohammed  al-Adnani al-Shami38	,  IS hasmentioned leading operations through local cells in neighbouring countries and encouraging its followers to do the same by organizing attacks in Europe or wherever else they reside
The number of fighters who wish to make their way to the warzone is declining as well, due to measures taken by countries affected, such as border surveillance
 Moreover, it would appear that IS’ allure has declined. As the situation on the ground does not correspond to what recruits were promised, there is a growing risk that such individuals will return home to carry out attacks of their own. The issue of logistics and financing is central, given that such operations are relatively cheap to carry out.According to the most recent 	UN report	, IS' financial situation continues to deteriorate; with the trend having first been outlined in the preceding September 2016 report
The UN assistance mission in Iraq estimates that IS raised USD 260 million from smuggling hydrocarbons in 2016, in comparison to USD 500 million it provided in 2015
 Revenues are thus in decline, yet remain substantial. The report underlines that the group ‘demonstrated resourcefulness in repairing or adapting equipment and infrastructure damaged by international coalition air strikes’.Terrorism is commonly understood to refer to acts of violence that target civilians in the pursuit of political or ideological aims
 In legal terms,although the international community has yet to adopt a comprehensive definition of terrorism, existing declarations, resolutions and universal “sectoral” treaties relating to specific aspects of it define certain acts and core elements
 In 1994, the General Assembly’s Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism, set out in its resolution 49/60, stated that terrorism includes “criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes” and that such acts “are in any circumstances unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them.”Ten years later, the Security Council, in its resolution 1566 (2004), referred to “criminal acts, including against civilians, committed with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury, or taking of hostages, with the purpose to provoke a state of terror in the general public or in a group of persons or particular persons, intimidate a population or compel a Government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act”
 Later that year, the Secretary-General’s High-level Panelon Threats, Challenges and Change described terrorism as any action that is “intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or noncombatants, when the purpose of such an act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a Government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act” and identified a number of key elements, with further reference to the definitions contained in the 1999 International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and Security Council resolution 1566 Terrorism aims at the very destruction of human rights, democracy and the rule of law
