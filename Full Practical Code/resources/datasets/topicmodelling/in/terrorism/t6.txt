16For example, deliberate acts of violence against civilians and civilian objects constitute war crimes under international law, for which individuals may be prosecuted
 This rule derives from the fundamental principleof international humanitarian law related to the protection of civilians in armed conflict, namely the principle of distinction
 According to thisprinciple, all parties to a conflict must at all times distinguish between civilians and combatants
 In essence, this means that attacks may bedirected only at military objectives, i
e., those objects which by their nature,location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances applicable at the time, offers a definite military advantage
Civilians lose their protection as civilians for such time as they participate directly in the hostilities
Counter-terrorism and national security measures undertaken by States have also had, in some case, an adverse impact on refugee protection
These include unduly restrictive legislative and administrative measures, lack of access to asylum procedures, and the “criminalization” of refugees and asylum-seekers, which has negatively affected public perception
Just as terrorism impacts on human rights and the functioning of society, so too can measures adopted by States to counter terrorism
 As mentionedabove, because terrorism has a serious impact on a range of fundamental human rights, States have not only a right but a duty to take effective counter-terrorism measures
