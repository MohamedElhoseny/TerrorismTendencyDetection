 We observe a similar trend in the increase of the period of detention in police custody of terrorist suspects in other European countries. It might be extended up to 4 days in Italy while in Spain the police may detain a suspect for up to five days without bringing him before a judge who might decide to extend the period up to 13 days. In Belgium, the proposition of the government to increase the period of police detention from 2 days to 3 days has generated as intense political debate.The extension of investigative powers is often complemented with restrictions on freedom of movements of suspected terrorists
These measures are essential in dealing with criminals who are able to exploit the weaknesses of the international security systems in a Europe without borders
The abolition of border and passport control in the Schengen area that comprises twenty-six European countries makes it difficult if not impossible to control the travels and traffics of terrorist groups
The European Union's decision to enforce the right of freedom of movement in a common market significantly undermines any attempts at developing a concerted European solution to this de facto impunity
 The apparent facility of entry and re-entry of Isis terrorist cells in Europe during the past year clearly shows the limits of the current European practice. Porous or inexistent borders between EU member states seem to work mostly to the benefit of the terrorists and not to the benefit of state security agencies that are still constrained by the multiple bureaucratic and structural hurdles that impair transnational cooperation. The large influx of political and religious refugees from the war zones in the Middle East and the resulting displacement of entire local communities further complicate a situation that is only partially controlled by the welcoming countries.Germany, France and Italy are facing a profound migrant crisis that poses a significant challenge to their asylum's rules and to the homogeneity and stability of their civil society
 The conflict between European ideals and the permanence of the international terrorist threat generates much alarm in the European public opinion. Several EU member states are rethinking their open borders policy that allows terrorists and criminal alike to evade the control of poorly coordinated national security agencies. The unexpected success of the pro-Brexit vote in the United Kingdom energized Euroskeptic movements in several countries as it expressed the people's doubts about the economic and cultural viability of the European Union model without borders which is unable to ensure the safety of its populations. The failure to monitor transnational movements of terrorism suspects underscores the necessity for European states to keep a better control on the movements of their own radicalized citizen who maintain contacts with ISIS and Al Qaeda operatives abroad. The expected defeat of ISIS and loss of its territory in Syria and Irak raise the threat of a return of ISIS fighter to European countries and social networks that would welcome and harbor them. The recent dismantling of dormant cells in Spain, France and Germany underscores the imminence of threats and the imperative necessity to increase the resources and legal tools that should provide the security agencies with better options in identifying returning terrorist fighters.British public authorities implemented restrictions on freedom of movements of suspected terrorists that were introduced by control orders during the years of the conflict in Northern Ireland
 The Prevention ofTerrorism Act (2005) implemented Control Orders that imposed various restrictions on free movement
 The legal challenges brought against this procedure led to their gradual replacement in 2011 with the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPIM) that are more adapted to the legal requirement imposed by the respect of the rule of law. TPIM may be decided by the Secretary of State with the control of the judiciary in cases of terrorism related activity for the protecting the public and the prevention of further activities in the activity. They comprise diverse options including House detention, Electronic Tagging, Assigned Residence and Forced Relocations. Restrictions on travel within or outside the UK may also be imposed.In France, the lawnÂ° 2014-1353 from 13 November 2014 established a procedure for the interdiction to leave the national territory
Article 224-1 of the Code of Interior security states that any French citizen may be prevented from leaving the French territory if there are serious reasons to believe that he is "moving abroad in order to take part in terrorist actions
"119l This interdiction to leave the French territory is valid for six month and requires the confiscation of the passport. It may be prolonged for justified reasons. Violation of the interdiction is punished by a three years imprisonment.We can find similar provisions in the article 4 of the recent Decree-Law from 18 February 2015 promulgated in Italy
