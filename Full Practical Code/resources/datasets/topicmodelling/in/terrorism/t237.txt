This president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS. They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world. So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president. If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming, you are not getting into the United States of America.
