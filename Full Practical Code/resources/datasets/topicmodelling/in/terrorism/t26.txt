 To crippleal Qaeda, the United States must gather timely and accurate information and attack its most important planners and leaders simultaneously
Otherwise, targeted killing at best will prevent an imminent attack, but it will not stop them all
The most important factor to consider is uncertainty
 When decidingwhether to target someone, American intelligence officials cannot be one hundred percent sure the person is in fact an al Qaeda leader or that the information about his location and timing is correct beyond any doubt
Even if it has collected all information possible - and information has a cost, just like any other good or service - the United States is still dealing with the probability that something will happen in the future
 Terrorists' planscan change at the last minute
 American intelligence may have identifiedthe wrong man, or it may have made a simple mistake (as with the erroneous bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade during the Kosovo war)
49)Using force to prevent future harms can never be done perfectly
 Nomilitary can choose the right target every time, nor can any military hit its target every time
 Soldiers might shoot someone who turns out to be anoncombatant, but was lurking around a known enemy location, or they might fire their cannons at the wrong building
