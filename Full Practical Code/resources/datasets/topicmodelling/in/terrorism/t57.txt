Bruce Ackerman, Sterling Professor of Law and Political Science at Yale, goes one step further, raising the problem of a de-sensitization to "war on terror" rhetoric, which allows the government to equate what may be only ideological or existential threats with actual public safety dangers. Ackerman proposes the creation of an "emergency constitution" that would come into effect only in the event of a catastrophic attack. At that time, the executive would assume full emergency powers through a congressional passage rate that is increased in step-wise fashion, an "escalating cascade of supermajorities." The step-wise increase ensures that the government would revert to its normal status and civil liberties would be restored once the state of emergency ended.
