Cyberterrorism, sometimes spelled "cyber terrorism," encompasses a range of malicious computer-based activity. Cyber terrorists specifically intend to break down information networks to access sensitive data and or illicitly modify existing frameworks to serve their own ends and spread fearfulness in a manner similar to physical terror attacks. Cyberterrorism is a multidimensional phenomenon to which computers and information networks are much more vulnerable than most people realize. The ever-evolving nature of technology, and the adaptability of hackers, requires dynamic efforts on several levels to recognize and effectively combat cyberterrorism in the information age.
