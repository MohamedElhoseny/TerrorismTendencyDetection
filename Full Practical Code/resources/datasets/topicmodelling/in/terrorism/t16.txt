 This cavil, however, ignores the fact that the September 11attacks were planned, controlled and financed by a foreign organization
Nor does the domestic site of the 9/11 attacks render them acts of crime rather than war
 True, the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal buildingwas a war-like attack, but it was carried out by a citizen associated with a group that was far too small and incoherent to suggest any need for war
Domestic violence can sometimes rise to the level of a rebellion or insurrection and qualify as war, like the Civil War
 If anything, the domesticlocation of the attacks should cause us deep concern, because it shows that a foreign enemy has pierced our defenses
Crime is an endemic, diffuse social problem that has afflicted all of mankind in all times
 By contrast, war is a set of discrete and violent actsundertaken by a nation or entity for political gain
 Were the attacksorganized and systematic enough to be considered "armed conflict"? The gravity and scale of September 11 surely crossed that threshold
 Oneinternational treaty defines armed conflict as attacks that rise above "riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence and other acts of a similar nature
