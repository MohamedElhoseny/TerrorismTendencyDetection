A: I've heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans because there's been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims. It's very short-sighted and dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric of Trump. We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see. I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations. Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Trump says and wondering, "why should we cooperate with the Americans?" This is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists. We are not at war with Islam.
