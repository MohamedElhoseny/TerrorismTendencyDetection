Although most parties are unwilling to admit it, Iran, Hezbollah, and various Iraqi Shia groups all are on the same side as the United States, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Israel when it came to fighting the Islamic State. However, this hasn’t produced better relations, because the United States seeks a different endgame than many of its de facto counterterrorism partners. Turkey fears a de facto Kurdish state, Iran seeks to cement its influence in Syria and bolster the Assad regime, while Israel fears violence spilling over onto its territory. Counterterrorism is not the glue that holds everything together—and, ironically, its success makes disagreements on other issues more apparent. Allies Need Coordination.
