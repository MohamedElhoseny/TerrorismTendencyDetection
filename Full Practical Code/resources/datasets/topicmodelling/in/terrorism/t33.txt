A corollary of the right to kill enemy personnel and destroy assets is that the deaths of civilians that occur as a result of legitimate attacks against military targets are not illegal
 This is the source of the idea of "collateraldamage," which made its controversial appearance in the Vietnam War
But the rule is as old as war itself
 The central principle of the laws of war isthat innocent civilians should not be targeted
 On the other hand, the rulesof war accept the death of civilians in or near legitimate military targets
62)Law recognizes that war does not yet amount to antiseptic surgery where we can zap cancers with lasers but leave healthy tissue nearby unharmed
Thus, the United States does not commit murder if it bombs a location that contains both bin Laden and his associates, on the one hand, and their family members on the other
 It does not commit murder in Iraq when, inthe course of a firefight with Uday and Qusay Hussein, who were holed up in a residential building in the middle of a densely populated city, civilians living next-door are harmed
 Rather, it is the terrorists who violate the rulesof war by deliberately hiding themselves and their bases of operation within civilian populations, thereby drawing unwilling and unsuspecting innocents into the fighting
 In another example of asymmetric tactics,terrorists multiply their strength by relying on the humanitarian morals of the West not to harm civilians
