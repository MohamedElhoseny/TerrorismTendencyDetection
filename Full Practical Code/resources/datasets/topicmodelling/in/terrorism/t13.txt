 Al Qaeda has nointerest in meeting American armed forces on the battlefield, but seeks to achieve its political aims via surprise attacks primarily on civilian targets using unconventional weapons and tactics
 Victory for al Qaeda does notmean defeat of the enemy's forces and a negotiated political settlement, but demoralizing our society and coercing it to act in ways that al Qaeda prefers
Another factor that distinguishes the conflict with al Qaeda from previous wars is jurisdiction
 In earlier modern American conflicts,hostilities took place on a foreign battlefield
 The United States home frontwas largely safe behind two oceans
 Today the battlefield may beanywhere
 Possessing no territory, population, or regular armed units, alQaeda depends on the covert use of global transportation and commercial channels to move its men and resources across borders undetected
 Thiserases the traditional boundaries between the battlefield and the home front
The United States has certainly faced violence from non-state actors before
 It used the criminal justice system to handle pirates, domestic terrorgroups, the mafia, and drug cartels
