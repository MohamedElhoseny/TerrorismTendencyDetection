Nancy V. Baker, Regents Professor and head of the Department of Government at New Mexico State University, responded to Ashcroft by saying, "This grim warning is particularly disturbing in the context of a war against terrorism, because the war has no clear end or scope; it is not waged against a nation-state or even an ideology, but against age-old methods of violence and terror; it is bound neither by time, geography, nor specific adversaries." She argued that framing terrorist attacks as "acts of war" rather than crimes has serious ramifications for the distribution of power in the federal government and can circumvent the system of checks and balances by placing too much power in the hands of the executive branch.
