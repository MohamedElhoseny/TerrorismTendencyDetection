The DHS has three primary objectives: to prevent attacks within the United States, to reduce the nation's vulnerability to terrorist attack and to minimize collateral damage after a terrorist attack. Since the agency's inception, the American public has engaged in a vigorous debate over issues such as oppressive legislation and the overextension of executive authority. The USA PATRIOT (Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism) Act, signed by President Bush on October 26, 2001, drew sharp criticism from civil libertarians for dramatically increasing the authority of the FBI and other law enforcement agencies to tap tele and e-mail communications, as well as search private medical and financial records.
