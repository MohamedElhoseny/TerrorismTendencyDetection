ISIS is a serious problem. Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them. The way to take that away is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "What do you need in order to accomplish this goal?" We take the oil from them, their source of revenue. Some of these engagement rules that the administration has--"we're not going to bomb a tanker because there might be a person in it"--give me a break.
