Cyberterrorism can be best understood by its distinction from what has been termed "cyber-crime." Cyber-crime is a broad term that describes illegal activities using computers. Identity theft is a classic exle of cyber-crime. Identity theft is the pilfering of personal data (for exle credit card numbers and bank account details) by falsely assuming someone else's identity. This is often done using a stolen email or online banking password. Identity thieves can illicitly access other sensitive records simply by obtaining someone's social security number and date of birth.
