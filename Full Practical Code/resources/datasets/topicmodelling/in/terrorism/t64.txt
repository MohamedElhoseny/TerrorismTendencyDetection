The September 11 2001 terror attacks in New York and Washington, D.C. resulted in a paradigm shift in how Americans viewed their security.

This meant that hacking and the spreading of computer viruses were no longer considered the pranks and nuisances of high school and college students. It became overwhelmingly clear that virtually anyone anywhere in the world with ill will toward the United States could instantaneously release a malicious computer code capable of compromising entire networks.
