The president is going to make a speech to outline to his strategy; the "next phase," as he put it, is going to be "going on the offensive against ISIL," his quote. This is not going to be an announcement on U.S. ground troops but will be similar to the kind of counterterrorism caigns we have carried out in the past. So what do you want to hear?
