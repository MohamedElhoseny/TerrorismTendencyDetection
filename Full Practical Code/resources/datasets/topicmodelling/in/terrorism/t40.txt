"103l The government's fight against ETA's armed struggle defined Spain's initial legal response to terrorism.104) The recent declaration of the Spanish lawmakers, in March 2015, introduced the new counter terrorist statute in these terms: "The experience of the struggle against terrorism has given us the possibility to rely upon a penal legislation that is efficient against acts of terrorism perpetrated by organized groups such as ETA or the GRAPO, these are well structured terrorists groups that are structured around one or more leaders, with a clear organic structure and repartition of distinct roles in the organization and with clear hierarchical relationship that are defined and observed by the members of the terrorist group.Terrorists are defined as "those belonging, acting in the service of or collaborating with armed groups, organizations or groups whose objective is to subvert the constitutional order or seriously alter public peace
"106)A comparative review of current legislation in the European countries that are the victims of terrorism reveals similar legislative patterns in the conception and implementation of legal measures for the prevention and the repression of terrorist acts
 These similitudes reflect not only the states' common penal philosophy but express also shared political values that govern the public authorities' preference for relying upon existing criminal law provisions and procedure while considering terrorism a domestic threat.The greater part of anti-terror legal measures is grouped in the Criminal Codes and Criminal Procedure Codes in the European countries that are part of the civil law tradition
107J This choice results from the combination of political, legal, institutional and social factors that influenced the governments' decision-making process.First, Democratic justifications put aside, the decision to consider terrorism as a domestic threat and to remain within the legal framework of the existing legislation is an expedient that reduces the risks of political crisis
From the ruling party's standpoint it presents the advantage of preempting unrest in the legislature and limiting the constitutional challenges that might undermine the cooperation of the players on the political chessboard
 Secondly, the decision not to deviate from the domestic approach tends to favor institutional continuity over the creation of new administrative structures that would be more adapted to the fight against international terrorism. This administrative conservatism relies upon the existing divisions that delimit the area of competence between the diverse jurisdictions of police and public security forces that are often protective of their own prerogatives. The institutional continuity benefits also from the implementation of legal procedures that result from the structure of the jurisdictional order. Thirdly, resorting to penal rules respects the overall consistency of the legal system without creating a concurrent system of rules that would create an extraordinary procedure under a state of exception. Finally from the society's perspective, there are reasons to believe that the existing legislation that is often the result of a political compromise, would be more protective of civil liberties than any type of exceptional measures that could undermine the social fabric of pluralist communities.However, the politically expedient choice to apply measures initially developed to combat domestic terrorism produces also diverse undesirable consequences
 On one hand, at the international level, it hampers the States' transnational cooperation as it upholds the fiction that terrorist attacks are a domestic and not an international problem. In doing so, it promotes a nationalist approach that encourages isolationism in the false belief that The terrorist attacks in Brussels in March 2016 and the use of this country as a base for terrorists units planning attacks in France or elsewhere fostered a renewed sense of urgency in amending the Belgium penal procedure code in order to address these new threats in a country which was until now ill equipped to deal effectively with transnational terrorism.The recent decision to modify the rule regulating home searches and to allow them during the night between 9:00 pm and 5:00 am reflects the government and the public opinion awareness of the terrorist threat
It repelled the former interdiction of night searches (between 9:00 pm and 5:00 am) that presumably prevented the Belgian police from apprehending the surviving member of the terrorist group responsible for the deadly Paris attacks in November 2015
113) Italy's decree-law and the law of conversion of 15 December 2001 streamlined bureaucratic procedures and expanded the searches to entire buildings or blocks of buildings when there is reason to believe that they might harbor terrorist suspects.114) Germany residential searches in the absence of owner's consent are authorized by article 104 of the code of criminal procedureIn France, preventive detention was first prolonged to 4 days by the statute on daily security in 2001 and 6 days in 2006 "when there exist a serious risk of imminent terrorist action in France or abroad and that the necessity of international cooperation requires it imperatively
measure has been rarely used since 2006 but the necessity to protect effectively the public from the growing threat of coordinated attacks by several terrorist units operating in concert requires better capacity to disrupt their logistics and support among radicalized religious groups
