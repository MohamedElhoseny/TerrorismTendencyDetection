We checked, and it is, according to a CNN article from April 2013: "A video from 2011 has resurfaced showing American-born al Qaeda spokesman Adam Gadahn discussing how easy it is to buy guns in the US & urging fellow radicals to do so.

Gadahn says, "You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle, without a background check. So what are you waiting for?"
