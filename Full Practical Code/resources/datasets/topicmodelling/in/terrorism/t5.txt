 While this distinction is notalways clear-cut, it is important to note that, in most cases, terrorist-related acts will be addressed as criminal offences committed by individuals and a State will not, in principle, be responsible for the illegal conduct itself
 Actsconstituting human rights violations are committed primarily by organs or persons in the name of, or on behalf of, the State
 In some circumstances,however, the State may be responsible for the acts of private individuals that may constitute a violation of international human rights law
While a comprehensive analysis of the needs of victims of crime and human rights violations in the context of terrorism, and of responses to those needs, is beyond the scope of this publication, several basic principles should be underscored
 In particular, international and regionalstandards with regard to victims of crime and victims of gross violations of international human rights law and serious violations of international 10 humanitarian law may be instructive in addressing the needs of victims of terrorism
14 Certain provisions of the universal treaties relating to specific aspects of terrorism are also relevant to addressing the situations of victims of terrorism.International humanitarian law contains a set of rules on the protection of persons in “armed conflict”, as that term is understood in the relevant treaties, as well as on the conduct of hostilities
 These rules are reflectedin a number of treaties, including the four Geneva Conventions and their two Additional Protocols, as well as a number of other international instruments aimed at reducing human suffering in armed conflict
 Manyof their provisions are now also recognized as customary international law
15There is no explicit definition of “terrorism” as such in international humanitarian law
 However, international humanitarian law prohibitsmany acts committed in armed conflict which would be considered terrorist acts if they were committed in times of peace
