Following Iraqi army’s recapture of Mosul from IS, which brought to light the extremist organisation’s weakened state and loss of territory, the question of the group’s very existence has come to the fore
 It would appear that a project aiming to establish and maintain a ‘caliphate’ straddling the Iraqi-Syrian border will buckle under the international coalition’s bombing campaign. That is not to say that it will be destroyed – the withdrawal of its fighters to Raqqa, IS’ ‘capital’ in Syria, proves its desire to continue to fight to achieve its objectives.Since 2014, when it took Mosul, IS has made use of its considerable financial means to invest in infrastructure
 Considered the world’s richest terrorist organisation, the group’s wealth allows it to control territories acquired by force, allowing it to pursue its expansionist agenda. Unlike previous organisations such as al-Qaeda, the group has been able to establish a ‘state’. IS’ territory provides it with access to natural resources such as oil, wheat and cotton, the sale of which is achieved through longstanding smuggling networks including illegal trafficking in antiquities.Yet, to pursue its project, a group such as IS needs funding to continue to exist and attract young would-be members
 But its sources of funding have considerably decreased across the board, whether because of the oil income lost through the bombing of oil wells and the drop in oil prices, reduced revenues from taxes levied on an increasingly destitute local population, or due to measures taken by the international community to hinder its financing. These various factors have the additional effect of hampering financial transfers and donations. Lastly, IS’ finances will be hurt by the loss of Mosul, the organisation’s ‘commercial capital’.The international community has an essential role to play in the fight against IS, a cause the United Nations and most of its constituent countries have taken up ever since it took stock of the danger the group posed not only to local populations, but to those struck by attacks perpetrated beyond the Middle East
IS’ decreased resources could compel it to demand that its followers strike their home turf, whether Europe, Turkey or Lebanon
 These operations can be carried out with limited resources while having a considerable effect on public opinion.The United Nations has established a binary mechanism to counter the financing of terrorism, the first under the authority of the Security Council and the second under the General Assembly
 Since 1999, the UN has takenup the issue of private contributors through the Security Council through resolutions and pertaining to IS, al-Qaeda’s network and the persons, groups, companies and various bodies that are linked to the two groups
 The aforementioned resolutions also foresee the implementation of sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).The European Union is also active in the fight against IS, especially in terms of adopting measures aiming to sever the terrorists’ financial networks
 The circulation of cash and the transfer of funds are both heavily regulated in order to increase the traceability of financial flows, all the while keeping an eye on digital platforms through which virtual currency can be exchanged.The Member States, taken individually, have a major responsibility to implement and enforce common decisions
  In this respect, the  European  Parliament  could  request information  on the different levels of commitment and progress Member States have realised in the fight against terrorism and, notably, efforts made to stem IS’ financing. It is evident that Member States cannot all muster the same level of engagement given their varying financial means, as well as the differing historical development of their administrations and police forces. However, it remains possible to build a common foundation, not only supported by EU institutions, but by those Member States that are most developed.The European Parliament could also request an annual reporting mechanism regarding the measures taken by the various Member States and the Commission pertaining to the fight against the funding of terrorism
At its largest, IS’ controlled territory straddling two countries, Syria and Iraq, stretched from north to south, from Palmyra to the Turkish border, and from east to west, starting as far East as Kobane (known as Ayn al- Arab before the conflict)
IS fills an ever-increasing vacuum in these two failed states, which explains the ease with which it was able to implant itself first in Iraq, then in Syria 
Qaeda, differing insofar as it managed to anchor itself territorially
 Indeed, following its creation in the mountains of Peshawar by Osama bin Laden in 1988, al-Qaeda, ‘the base’ in Arabic, did not seek to implant itself geographically. Instead, the organisation strove to attack the ‘far enemy’, that is ‘the United States, Zionists and crusaders’. Attacks were consequently launched against the American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya (1998), the American destroyer USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden (2000), followed by that of 9/11. Osama bin Laden, born into a Saudi family with Yemeni roots, funded such operations through his personal fortune.While the 9/11 attack gave al-Qaeda an international audience, it was not able to launch any further attacks on such a large scale
 This led to jihadi ideologues such as Abu Musab al-Suri2  calling the organisation’s strategy into question, arguing that the focus should be on carrying out attacks on European soil, where large Muslim communities lived. Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi, founder of al-Qaeda, followed by its current leader al-Baghdadi, have both cited al-Suri’s doctrines. The organisation also distinguished itself by targeting Shiite Muslims. Its aim was to create clandestine, isolated cells overseen by a centralised command structure in order to prevent their detection. Gilles Kepel called this the restructured, ‘grassroots’ jihad,which he described as 	nizam la tanzim	 (a system and not an organisation) while adding: ‘al-Suri uploaded, in January 2005, his book ‘The Global Islamic Resistance Call’ which described Europe as targeted by a form of grassroots jihad whose foot soldiers would be recruited from the ranks of 45 million European Muslims’
Such theoreticians recognised that a form of  ‘shock-and-awe’  terrorism,  engaging in tactics of mass destruction, had become impossible
 They thus strove to play their enemies off against each other, creating a societal rift between the local population and Muslims in order to incite them to leave the country in which they resided and make their way to lands where they could live in harmony with Islam’s precepts.IS’ project aims to establish a caliphate within which the world’s Muslims can settle
 Its objective is to establish such a caliphate on territory from which it can wage an international jihad. This project thus differs from al-Qaeda’s and was first implemented in Iraq, due to the country’s profound destabilisation as a result of successive foreign military interventions. The last such intervention, in 2003, ravaged the country. IS continued by expanding into Syria, taking advantage of Bashar al-Assad’s lack of control over the entirety of his territory, to establish its ‘capital’ as Raqqa.Another element must be considered in order to better understand IS’ expansion and its ability to attract numerous individuals into its ranks
 Unlike al-Qaeda, which is fundamentally elitist in nature, IS is a ‘catch- all’ organisation which recruits also those who are inexperienced, naïve and unwitting as well as many women as possible. Following the American intervention in Iraq and the implementation of a political project aiming to achieve a better representation of Iraqis within the political sphere, the Shiite majority, long  suppressed  by  the  Sunni  minority  under  Saddam  Hussein, took  power.  The  Sunnis were  thus marginalised, excluded from the political process by a vengeful minority that had been relegated to the side-lines for decades. Spurred by their total exclusion from the political sphere, a number of Sunnis began to gravitate towards Salafist movements, despite a period in which they hoped to have their voice heard.Even this period, known as the 	Sahwa (‘awakening’) tribal movement of 2007-2008, was but a flash in the pan3 
As a result, IS’ structure is particularly hybridised
 On the one hand, the organisation’s Iraqi component is largely made up of ex-soldiers who had served under Saddam Hussein and then fought against the Shiite- dominated power-centre in Baghdad, as well as of Sunni tribes which had been discriminated against by the Shiite elite. On the other, it is composed of universalist jihadists5  from the al-Zarqawi school (who have a greater presence in Syria), embodied by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi6 . Also going by either his real name, Ibrahim Awad Ali al-Badri, as well as such monikers as al-Husseini and al-Qurashi, or even Caliph Ibrahim among his supporters, he was born in 1971 in Iraq. He is said to have become radicalised during the American invasion of Iraq, having been subsequently imprisoned. He rubbed shoulders with al-Qaeda leaders during his incarceration, joining Islamic State of Iraq when the organisation was founded in 2006. He became leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq in 2010 but ended up by breaking ties with the organisation’s leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, by refusing to pledge allegiance to him. He declared the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in 2014.IS’ existence, as well as its ability to mobilise, concerns the Sunni community’s representation
 Who can now represent it in Iraq ? Pressure has built up to a point where IS’ internal priorities have shifted from state building to military engagements
  In May 2016, through its spokesperson 	Abu Mohammed  al-Adnani al-Shami38	,  IS hasmentioned leading operations through local cells in neighbouring countries and encouraging its followers to do the same by organizing attacks in Europe or wherever else they reside
The number of fighters who wish to make their way to the warzone is declining as well, due to measures taken by countries affected, such as border surveillance
 Moreover, it would appear that IS’ allure has declined. As the situation on the ground does not correspond to what recruits were promised, there is a growing risk that such individuals will return home to carry out attacks of their own. The issue of logistics and financing is central, given that such operations are relatively cheap to carry out.According to the most recent 	UN report	, IS' financial situation continues to deteriorate; with the trend having first been outlined in the preceding September 2016 report
The UN assistance mission in Iraq estimates that IS raised USD 260 million from smuggling hydrocarbons in 2016, in comparison to USD 500 million it provided in 2015
 Revenues are thus in decline, yet remain substantial. The report underlines that the group ‘demonstrated resourcefulness in repairing or adapting equipment and infrastructure damaged by international coalition air strikes’.Terrorism is commonly understood to refer to acts of violence that target civilians in the pursuit of political or ideological aims
 In legal terms,although the international community has yet to adopt a comprehensive definition of terrorism, existing declarations, resolutions and universal “sectoral” treaties relating to specific aspects of it define certain acts and core elements
 In 1994, the General Assembly’s Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism, set out in its resolution 49/60, stated that terrorism includes “criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes” and that such acts “are in any circumstances unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them.”Ten years later, the Security Council, in its resolution 1566 (2004), referred to “criminal acts, including against civilians, committed with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury, or taking of hostages, with the purpose to provoke a state of terror in the general public or in a group of persons or particular persons, intimidate a population or compel a Government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act”
 Later that year, the Secretary-General’s High-level Panelon Threats, Challenges and Change described terrorism as any action that is “intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or noncombatants, when the purpose of such an act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a Government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act” and identified a number of key elements, with further reference to the definitions contained in the 1999 International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and Security Council resolution 1566 Terrorism aims at the very destruction of human rights, democracy and the rule of law
 It attacks the values that lie at the heart of the Charter of theUnited Nations and other international instruments: respect for human rights; the rule of law; rules governing armed conflict and the protection of civilians; tolerance among peoples and nations; and the peaceful resolution of conflict
Terrorism has a direct impact on the enjoyment of a number of human rights, in particular the rights to life, liberty and physical integrity
 Terroristacts can destabilize Governments, undermine civil society, jeopardize peace and security, threaten social and economic development, and may especially negatively affect certain groups
 All of these have a direct impacton the enjoyment of fundamental human rights
The destructive impact of terrorism on human rights and security has been recognized at the highest level of the United Nations, notably by the Security Council, the General Assembly, the former Commission on Human Rights and the new Human Rights Council
7 Specifically, MemberStates have set out that terrorism: From a human rights perspective, support for victims in the context of terrorism is a paramount concern
 While efforts immediately followingthe events of 11 September 2001 largely failed to give due consideration to the human rights of victims, there is increasing recognition of the need for the international community to take fully into account the human rights of all victims of terrorism
 In the 2005 World Summit Outcome(General Assembly resolution 60/1), for example, Member States stressed “the importance of assisting victims of terrorism and of providing them and their families with support to cope with their loss and their grief
”Similarly, the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy reflects the pledge by Member States to “promote international solidarity in support of victims and foster the involvement of civil society in a global campaign against terrorism and for its condemnation
”In addressing the needs of victims of terrorism, consideration must be given to the distinction between victims of crime, on the one hand, and victims of human rights violations, on the other
 While this distinction is notalways clear-cut, it is important to note that, in most cases, terrorist-related acts will be addressed as criminal offences committed by individuals and a State will not, in principle, be responsible for the illegal conduct itself
 Actsconstituting human rights violations are committed primarily by organs or persons in the name of, or on behalf of, the State
 In some circumstances,however, the State may be responsible for the acts of private individuals that may constitute a violation of international human rights law
While a comprehensive analysis of the needs of victims of crime and human rights violations in the context of terrorism, and of responses to those needs, is beyond the scope of this publication, several basic principles should be underscored
 In particular, international and regionalstandards with regard to victims of crime and victims of gross violations of international human rights law and serious violations of international 10 humanitarian law may be instructive in addressing the needs of victims of terrorism
14 Certain provisions of the universal treaties relating to specific aspects of terrorism are also relevant to addressing the situations of victims of terrorism.International humanitarian law contains a set of rules on the protection of persons in “armed conflict”, as that term is understood in the relevant treaties, as well as on the conduct of hostilities
 These rules are reflectedin a number of treaties, including the four Geneva Conventions and their two Additional Protocols, as well as a number of other international instruments aimed at reducing human suffering in armed conflict
 Manyof their provisions are now also recognized as customary international law
15There is no explicit definition of “terrorism” as such in international humanitarian law
 However, international humanitarian law prohibitsmany acts committed in armed conflict which would be considered terrorist acts if they were committed in times of peace
16For example, deliberate acts of violence against civilians and civilian objects constitute war crimes under international law, for which individuals may be prosecuted
 This rule derives from the fundamental principleof international humanitarian law related to the protection of civilians in armed conflict, namely the principle of distinction
 According to thisprinciple, all parties to a conflict must at all times distinguish between civilians and combatants
 In essence, this means that attacks may bedirected only at military objectives, i
e., those objects which by their nature,location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances applicable at the time, offers a definite military advantage
Civilians lose their protection as civilians for such time as they participate directly in the hostilities
Counter-terrorism and national security measures undertaken by States have also had, in some case, an adverse impact on refugee protection
These include unduly restrictive legislative and administrative measures, lack of access to asylum procedures, and the “criminalization” of refugees and asylum-seekers, which has negatively affected public perception
Just as terrorism impacts on human rights and the functioning of society, so too can measures adopted by States to counter terrorism
 As mentionedabove, because terrorism has a serious impact on a range of fundamental human rights, States have not only a right but a duty to take effective counter-terrorism measures
 Effective counter-terrorism measures and theprotection of human rights are complementary and mutually reinforcing objectives which must be pursued together as part of States’ duty to protect individuals within their jurisdiction
As referred to in chapter I, section E, the Security Council acted swiftly, following the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, to strengthen the legal framework for international cooperation and common approaches to the threat of terrorism in such areas as preventing its financing, reducing the risk that terrorists might acquire weapons of mass destruction and improving cross-border information-sharing by law enforcement authorities, as well as establishing a monitoring body, the Counter-Terrorism Committee, to supervise the implementation of these measures
 Regional approaches have also been developed in the contextof the African Union, the Council of Europe, the European Union, the League of Arab States, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Organization of American States, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and other organizations
There has been a proliferation of security and counter-terrorism legislation and policy throughout the world since the adoption of Security Council resolution 1373 (2001), much of which has an impact on the enjoyment of human rights
 Most countries, when meeting their obligations to counterterrorism by rushing through legislative and practical measures, have created negative consequences for civil liberties and fundamental human rights
 The most relevant human rights concerns which States should takeseriously to ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism For decades, the United States had dealt with terrorism primarily as a crime subject to the criminal justice system
 In response to previous alQaeda attacks, the United States dispatched FBI agents to investigate the "crime scene" and tried to apprehend terrorist "suspects
" Federalprosecutors succeeded in putting a few of them on trial in federal court in New York
1) Ironically, a federal judge issued rulings on the 1993 WorldTrade Center bombing just weeks before the hijacked planes crashed into the towers
 Efforts to capture or kill al Qaeda leader Osama bin Ladenthroughout the 1990's were shelved, out of concerns that the Justice Department did not have enough evidence to satisfy the legal standard for a criminal arrest
 Bipartisan studies of the failings that led up to theSeptember 11 attacks almost all refer to the inadequacy of the criminal justice approach to prevent or deal effectively with an ideologically motivated organization like al Qaeda
On September 11, 2001, four coordinated attacks had taken place in rapid succession, aimed at critical buildings at the heart of our national financial system and our nation's capitol
 The terrorists who hijacked theseairplanes in some ways had conventional military objectives - to decapitate America's political, military, and economic headquarters
 They failed at thefirst, partially achieved the second (the American Airlines flight from Dulles airport to Los Angeles struck a recently modernized and reinforced section of the Pentagon, resulting in far lower casualties and destruction), and succeeded at the third
 The attacks killed more people than had died atPearl Harbor, approximately three thousand, with thousands more injuries
They also disrupted air traffic and communications, closed the national stock exchanges for days, and caused billions of dollars in damage
If a state of war existed between the United States and al Qaeda, the United States would not longer find itself limited to domestic law enforcement authorities
 The United States can use its war powers to useforce to kill enemy operatives and their leaders, detain them without trial until the end of the conflict, interrogate them without lawyers or Miranda protections, and try them without civilian juries
 No doubt these measuresseem unusual, even draconian, but the rules of war provide nations with their most forceful tools to defend their people from attack
 Thefundamental question, which still sits at the center of the debate over U
S.counter-terrorism today, is whether a nation can wage an international armed conflict against a non-state
there would be no question about whether a state of war would exist
 If,during the Cold War, the Soviet Union had sent KGB agents to drive airplanes through American skyscrapers, the United States would have retaliated, it would have gone on a war footing, and its mutual self-defense agreements with other countries would have been triggered
 Why shouldan energy's status as an international terrorist organization rather than a nation-state make a difference as to whether war exists? While al Qaeda was not a household word before the September 11 attacks, the United States had suffered repeated attacks at its hands
 These include the suicidebombing of the U
S.S. Cole in 2000, the bombing of American embassies inKenya and Tanzania in 1998, the attack on a U
S. military housing complexin Saudi Arabia in 1996, and the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993
 Only good intelligence and law enforcement work, helpful allies, andluck had frustrated planned attacks on American airliners over the Pacific Ocean, Los Angeles airport during the millennium, and various American embassies and personnel in Europe and Asia
Critics of the American response focus on the unconventional nature of the attacks
 The attacks bore important differences with wars of the past.The attackers wore no uniforms, carried no arms openly, and did not operate as part of regular military units
 Instead, Mohammed Atta and hiseighteen fellow hijackers disguised themselves as civilians, used civilian aircraft as weapons, and launched their attacks by surprise from within our The attacks were both vicious and skillful
 Al Qaeda's operativesinfiltrated past U
S. immigration and border controls, operated within theborders for years, and gained the skills needed to fly airplanes at schools in the U
S. without detection by American intelligence or law enforcement.They simultaneously hijacked four aircraft within minutes of each other, and succeeded in hitting three of their targets with devastating effect
 Eventhough they were going to their certain deaths, the hijackers maintained operational security for years, and managed to take the United States completely by surprise
 Without any conventional armed forces or themilitary resources of a nation-state, al Qaeda inflicted a level of destruction on the United States within the grasp of the conventional forces of only a few nations
The most singular and defining characteristic of the hijackers is their statelessness
 Al Qaeda is a network of terrorists who wish to engineerfundamental political and social change in the Middle East
 They fight onbehalf of a network of Islamic radicals who have dedicated themselves to a jihad against the West
 Many were from Saudi Arabia, one of the UnitedStates' closest allies in the Middle East
 Some members, including binLaden, were veterans of the successful resistance to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan
 With the help of Saudi funding, the Reagan administrationhad helped train and arm mujahadeen resistance fighters from many different Arab countries to defeat the Soviets
 When the war ended, some ofthese fighters banded together with the aim of overthrowing Arab regimes at home
 They seethed at the rise of the Christian West and the decline ofthe Islamic caliphate, which had once stretched from India to Spain
 Theyattributed the reversal of Islam's fortunes to the military strength of the United States and the cooperation of Arab regimes, which they saw as corrupt and untrue to fundamentalist Islamic principles
Al Qaeda members are bound not by national allegiance, but a shared view of the world
 They understand recent history as a manichaeanstruggle between Islam and the West
3) To them, the United States is thecause of the conflicts and reverses suffered by the Islamic world
 Al Qaedathinkers believe America must be forced to withdraw from the Middle East and its citizens converted to Islam
 Attacking the United States serves theobjective of undermining its Arab allies in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan and replacing them with a fundamentalist Islamic caliphate
4l "Our fightagainst these governments is not separate from our fight against" the United States, bin Laden said
5) Al Qaeda had articulated its goals at least asearly as 1996, when bin Laden issued a fatwa-an interpretation of Islamic law - calling on Muslims to drive American troops out of the Middle East
Two years later, bin Laden and his number two, Egyptian doctor Ayman al Zawahiri, declared war against all Americans, saying that it is "the individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it" to kill an American
6) In an ABC interview shortlythereafter, bin Laden said that "the worst thieves in the world today and the worst terrorists are the Americans
 Nothing could stop you exceptperhaps retaliation in kind
"7J The question was never whether al Qaedawanted to attack the United States and kill its citizens
 The question wasonly if it had the wherewithal to carry out its threats
Al Qaeda operates in an unconventional and, as strategic analysts like to say, asymmetric manner
 Its operatives do not wear uniforms, nor do theyform conventional units or force structures
 Rather, their personnel,material, and leadership are organized in covert cells
 Al Qaeda has nointerest in meeting American armed forces on the battlefield, but seeks to achieve its political aims via surprise attacks primarily on civilian targets using unconventional weapons and tactics
 Victory for al Qaeda does notmean defeat of the enemy's forces and a negotiated political settlement, but demoralizing our society and coercing it to act in ways that al Qaeda prefers
Another factor that distinguishes the conflict with al Qaeda from previous wars is jurisdiction
 In earlier modern American conflicts,hostilities took place on a foreign battlefield
 The United States home frontwas largely safe behind two oceans
 Today the battlefield may beanywhere
 Possessing no territory, population, or regular armed units, alQaeda depends on the covert use of global transportation and commercial channels to move its men and resources across borders undetected
 Thiserases the traditional boundaries between the battlefield and the home front
The United States has certainly faced violence from non-state actors before
 It used the criminal justice system to handle pirates, domestic terrorgroups, the mafia, and drug cartels
 But there is a line, however indistinct,between crime and war
 Crime is generally committed for personal gain orprofit rather than a larger political goal
 Drug cartels employ murder,kidnapping, robbery, and destruction to create a distribution network, grab turf from other gangs, intimidate rivals or customers, and even retaliate in military fashion against law enforcement
 Al Qaeda resembles organizedcrime like the Mafia in some respects, but the Mafia is unconcerned with ideology and is primarily out to satisfy its greed
War involves opposing political objectives
 The United States went towar in World War II to achieve regime change in Germany and Japan
 Itresorted to armed force in Korea, Vietnam, and Panama, among other places, to stop the spread of harmful ideologies or to remove corrupt regimes
 Like a nation, al Qaeda's attacks are highly organized, military innature, and are aimed at achieving ideological and political objectives
 BJCrime can certainly be involved in its fundraising efforts, such as stealing money or defrauding charities, but Al Qaeda uses this money for military and intelligence efforts rather than the mere accumulation of wealth
 Anenemy's conscious political object also distinguishes war from an emergency, which can arise from an act of God, such as Hurricane Katrina or a pandemic, or impersonal market forces, such as the Great Depression
9lThe difference in purpose dictates different tools
 The FBI and theDEA-not the U
S. armed forces-has primary responsibility for interdictingdrug smuggling (although the military sometimes plays a supporting role)
They seek to disrupt the operations of drug cartels with traditional tools of law enforcement: interviewing witnesses, collecting physical evidence, and carrying out surveillance
 An investigation usually occurs only after a crimehas occurred
 Deadly force may be used only if necessary to defend the lawenforcement agent's life, or another's, against an imminent attack
 In war,nations use special powers to prevent future attacks on their citizens and territory, not to punish past conduct
 Law enforcement tries to solve crimesthat have occurred in the past
 National military and intelligence agentsseek to stop deadly, foreign attacks that may happen in the future
Critics of the war on terror often point to the fact that the attacks of September 11 began and ended in the U
S. and are thus only domesticcriminal acts
 This cavil, however, ignores the fact that the September 11attacks were planned, controlled and financed by a foreign organization
Nor does the domestic site of the 9/11 attacks render them acts of crime rather than war
 True, the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal buildingwas a war-like attack, but it was carried out by a citizen associated with a group that was far too small and incoherent to suggest any need for war
Domestic violence can sometimes rise to the level of a rebellion or insurrection and qualify as war, like the Civil War
 If anything, the domesticlocation of the attacks should cause us deep concern, because it shows that a foreign enemy has pierced our defenses
Crime is an endemic, diffuse social problem that has afflicted all of mankind in all times
 By contrast, war is a set of discrete and violent actsundertaken by a nation or entity for political gain
 Were the attacksorganized and systematic enough to be considered "armed conflict"? The gravity and scale of September 11 surely crossed that threshold
 Oneinternational treaty defines armed conflict as attacks that rise above "riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence and other acts of a similar nature
"10)The Bali, Madrid and London episodes, together with bombings in Iraq and Israel, are part of a sustained and coordinated campaign against the United States and our allies by a single network in pursuit of an ideological agenda
Although it seems circular, one way to know if the line between crime has been crossed is simply whenever there is a military response
 Choicedriven by necessity creates war, not a hovering zeitgeist called "law
" Ifonly the military has the capability to do what must be done, like destroy enemy camps in Afghanistan, and it is sent to do it, then it is war
 The factof a military response is one way international law decides if an action constitutes war
11l In fact, if terrorism were a criminal problem, the U.S.could barely use the military at all, thanks to the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the use of the armed forces to enforce our laws except in times of narrow emergencies
12) Though diplomacy and law enforcement will play important roles, few truly believe that non-military tools alone can bring al Qaeda to justice and prevent future attacks
 War is violence on alarge scale, of the kind we saw on September 11, undertaken for political reasons by a foreign state or entity, which requires a military response
The terminology "war on terrorism" causes confusion by suggesting that we are at war with a combat method, not a concrete enemy
 As formerCIA Director James Woolsey has pointed out, "war against terrorism" is like a "war against kamikazes
" The war on terror to many ears also soundsa lot like the avowedly metaphorical "war on drugs" that has always been fought as a criminal matter
13) American political leaders have watered down "war" in the interests of mobilizing political campaigns to solve persistent social problems
 But the United States is not at war with everyterrorist group in the world, or all who employ terrorist tactics, or a social problem, but with al Qaeda
Rhetoric aside, that the United States is engaged in an international armed conflict with the al Qaeda terrorist organization is perfectly clear, however much politics may fog the issue
 Critics are entitled to try to get afederal court to rule that this is not war, or that war rules do not apply, or that the U
S. must use only criminal law enforcement tools. So far, thecourts have not upheld this position
 The Supreme Court's 2004 decision onenemy combatants was read by some as dealing a blow to the Bush administration's interpretation of the war on terrorism
 Rasul v. Bush heldthat the federal courts will- for the first time - review the grounds for detaining alien enemy combatants held outside the United States
14l InHamdi v
 Rumsfeld, the Justices required that American citizens detained inHowever, on closer examination, Hamdi actually affirmed the Bush administration's basic legal approach to this war and left the executive branch plenty of flexibility to prevail in the future
 Despite enormouspolitical pressure from the media and activist litigators, the Justices did not tum the clock back to September 10, 2001
 They agreed that the UnitedStates was indeed at war, one authorized by Congress
 As Justice O'Connorwrote for the Court's plurality: On this point, the Court affirmed the shared view of the political branches
 In the wake of the 9-11 attacks, the President and Congressmoved quickly to recognize the state of war between the United States and al Qaeda
 In his address to a joint session of Congress on September 20,2001, President Bush declared: "On September the 11th, enemies of freedom committed an act of war against our country
"17) And in November, 2001,President Bush issued an executive order which stated: "International terrorists, including members of al Qaeda, have carried out attacks on United States diplomatic and military personnel and facilities abroad and on citizens and property within the United States on a scale that has created a state of armed conflict that requires the use of the United States Armed Forces Congress agreed
 On September 18, Congress enacted an Authorizationfor the Use of Military Force (AUMF), if not a declaration of war in name, a declaration of war in purpose
 It pronounced the September 11 attacks"grave acts of violence" that "pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States" and justified a military response: "such acts render it both necessary and appropriate that the United States exercise its rights to self-defense and to protect United States citizens both at home and abroad
" (Under international law, theright to self-defense is triggered by an armed attack or the threat of one
)Congress recognized that "the President has authority under the Constitution to take action to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against the United States
"If the views of the Bush administration's critics were to prevail, and the September 11 and other terror attacks amounted only to crimes, the American legal system would grant al Qaeda terrorists better legal treatment than that afforded to combatants who follow the rules of war
 Themechanisms of criminal justice forbid government searches of suspects or their possessions without a warrant issued by a neutral magistrate
 Policecannot arrest a criminal without probable cause and upon arrest must provide a suspect with Miranda warnings, a lawyer, and the right to remain silent
 A suspect has the constitutional right to a speedy trial by a jury, andin that proceeding, can demand that the government tum over all of its information about the crime and the suspect to him
 He can cross-examinethat information and call his own witnesses into open court
 The governmentmust provide all exculpatory evidence to the defendant and access to witnesses who have any information relevant to the trial
 A convicteddefendant can appeal to higher courts to challenge the verdict and then file for a writ of habeas corpus seeking federal judicial review of any constitutional errors in the trial
To protect the innocent, the Constitution's Bill of Rights is expensive,· tilts in favor of the suspect, and imposes high standards of proof on the government
 While police can arrest based on "probable cause," a suspectmust be released if prosecutors cannot proceed to trial
 Courts can onlyconvict if a jury finds that the government has shown "proof beyond a reasonable doubt," which often means something close to 99 percent certainty
 Federal courts and the Supreme Court supervise these rules,which can take years of trials and appeals
 If police make a mistake, even ingood faith, such as seizing evidence without a proper warrant or failing to read a Miranda warning correctly, the courts will sanction the government by releasing the suspect regardless of the threat he poses to society
19l AsJustice Cardozo once observed, "the criminal is to go free because the constable has blundered
"20lThe Framers established this constitutional system because of their concerns over the power of the government
Many of the claimed successes in the war on terrorism have come about thanks to targeted strikes against specific al Qaeda targets
 Despite itscampaign criticism of Bush's approach to the war, the Obama administration accelerated the use of drones to strikes not just in Iraq and Afghanistan but also in Pakistan and Yemen
33lLeon Panetta, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, publicly stated that the drone strikes in Pakistan are "the only game in town in terms of confronting or trying to disrupt the al Qaeda leadership
"34) In the Obamaadministration's first year, the number of drone attacks reportedly exceeded the total under the Bush administration's eight years
35J In March2010, Harold Koh, who had criticized the Bush administration's policies on detention, interrogations, use of drones, and other issues while serving as the dean of the Yale Law School, vigorously and publicly defended drone strikes as the legal adviser of the State Department These criticisms rest on profound misconceptions of the nature of the war on terrorism and the rules of warfare
 Because the United States is at warwith al Qaeda, it can use force - especially targeted force - to conduct hostilities against the enemy's leaders
 This does not violate any Americanlaw-constitutional, congressional, or presidential-or any ratified treaty
Precise attacks against individuals have long been a feature of warfare
 Theseattacks further the goals of the laws of war by eliminating the enemy and reducing harm to innocent civilians
 Legality aside, targeted killing orassassination can be the best policy in certain circumstances
 In the new typeof war thrust upon the United States by the 9/11 attacks, the enemy resembles a network, not a nation
 The better strategy is to attack the individuals in thatnetwork; there are no armed forces to target, and destroying training camps alone will amount to no more than" pounding sand
"Launching a missile to kill al Qaeda commanders, even American citizens such as Anwar al-Awlaki, is legal
 They are members of the enemyforces, the equivalent of officers
 The U.S. military and intelligence servicesare legally and morally free to target them for attack whether they were on the front lines or behind them
 Killing an enemy commander will betterpromote the principles behind the rules of civilized war than other means
Over the centuries, the laws and customs of war have developed to reduce the harm to noncombatants and limit the use of force to that which is proportional to military objectives
 By specifically targeting enemy leaders,the United States can render enemy forces leaderless and frustrate their operations, prevent the enemy from mounting effective plots and campaigns, and reduce both civilian and military casualties Using targeted killing as a primary tactic also takes better account of the new kind of war facing the United States
 Al Qaeda does not mass itsoperatives into units onto a battlefield, or at least it has not after its setbacks in Afghanistan in the fall and winter of 2001
 Instead, al Qaeda willcontinue to disguise its members as civilians, hide its bases in remote mountains and deserts or among unsuspecting city populations, and avoid military confrontation
 The only way for the United States to defeat alQaeda is to destroy its ability to function by selectively killing or capturing its key members
Al Qaeda is a social network of friends, acquaintances, or companies interlocked through various cross-ownerships and relationships; it is not unlike the Internet, which gives it remarkable resiliency
 A killed orcaptured leader seems to be quickly replaced by the promotion of a more junior member and, as in Iraq, other arms of the network spring to the fore
Most nation-states would have collapsed after the kinds of losses inflicted by the armed forces and the CIA over the last decade: thousands of operatives killed, two thirds of al Qaeda's leadership killed or captured, and its open bases and infrastructure destroyed in Afghanistan
45l But alQaeda operatives continue to attempt to infiltrate the United States, and they have succeeded in carrying out terrorist attacks in London, Madrid, and Bali Al Qaeda exhibits the typical characteristics of what is known as a freescale network free-scale network is not created at random
 It is madeup of nodes-connected to each other for some purpose-around hubs, which are nodes with multiple connections to other nodes
 They are notcommand-and-control hierarchies like the Defense Department
 In terms ofthe Internet, hubs are highly trafficked websites with connections to many other sites, such as Google
com, Yahoo.com, and MSN.com. Users visitthem often in order to connect to other sites, and a great many other sites connect to them as well
 In a social or professional network, hubs arepeople that are widely known, who set trends or whose work influences a great many others
Decentralization is another attribute
 Because of decentralization, anetwork can quickly collect and process information from a myriad of sources located in different places and connected only by a common interest or affinity
 If a node disappears, others simply move their connections.Networks can remain remarkably immune to attack
 Randomlydestroying its nodes will not cause it to collapse, and the loss of a single hub will not bring down the whole network
 Therefore, because it has noreal single leader, it can function even after suffering severe losses
Al Qaeda is just such a network
 Each node is a terrorist seeking toconnect with another through a desire to promote Islamic fundamentalism in the Middle East by any means necessary, including violence
 Its hubs areleaders, such as bin Laden and Zawahiri, and facilitators, such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ramzi Binalshibh
48l Capturing or killing an alQaeda member is important for the discovery of other cells and plots to which he is connected
 However, taking out single operatives is notcrippling; other parts of the network can continue to function
The United States must target al Qaeda hubs
 Random, individualattacks on a free-scale network will not work
 Turning off random websiteswill have almost no effect on the Internet, but closing down a Google
comor Yahoo
com might have a serious effect on Internet usage and traffic.Similarly, killing or capturing an ordinary al Qaeda operative will cripple one cell, but al Qaeda will only replace that cell with others
 Even significantal Qaeda facilitators eliminated one at a time will permit replacements to be trained or communications and contacts shifted to other leaders
 To crippleal Qaeda, the United States must gather timely and accurate information and attack its most important planners and leaders simultaneously
Otherwise, targeted killing at best will prevent an imminent attack, but it will not stop them all
The most important factor to consider is uncertainty
 When decidingwhether to target someone, American intelligence officials cannot be one hundred percent sure the person is in fact an al Qaeda leader or that the information about his location and timing is correct beyond any doubt
Even if it has collected all information possible - and information has a cost, just like any other good or service - the United States is still dealing with the probability that something will happen in the future
 Terrorists' planscan change at the last minute
 American intelligence may have identifiedthe wrong man, or it may have made a simple mistake (as with the erroneous bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade during the Kosovo war)
49)Using force to prevent future harms can never be done perfectly
 Nomilitary can choose the right target every time, nor can any military hit its target every time
 Soldiers might shoot someone who turns out to be anoncombatant, but was lurking around a known enemy location, or they might fire their cannons at the wrong building
 In domestic law enforcement,which is governed by tougher standards, a police officer who fires his weapon on the reasonable belief that his attacker holds a gun is not punished by law, even if it turns out that his belief was in error
 We ask thatour soldiers make reasonable decisions when they choose their targets and decide how much force to use
 Similarly, our policymakers consider all ofthese factors when they decide whether to use deadly force against a suspected al Qaeda member
 They must balance matters like the effect of anattack on allied governments, local populations, and nearby civilians against the benefit of eliminating an al Qaeda leader and frustrating the plans he might have been organizing, while also keeping in mind the probability of success in the attack
Killing an individual, of course, is not legal in all circumstances
 Nor is itillegal in all circumstances
 Killing an individual can be legal when it iscarried out by the state as criminal punishment of a convicted first-degree murder by a capital jury
 It can be legal when a police officer shoots anattacker armed with a weapon
 It can be illegal when it is murder, as withany of the thousands of premeditated murders that occur in the United States every year
 It is illegal when it is "assassination." But killing theenemy in wartime is legal
The United States has the right, as a nation, to use force to defend itself
However, under the United Nations Charter, member states must refrain "from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations
"50) No exceptions were granted, such as forpreventing humanitarian disasters or rooting out terrorist organizations, except for two: interventions authorized by the U
N. Security Council "asmay be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security"51l and "the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence
" 52) According to long state practice, and hence customary international law, this right applies not only after a nation has suffered an attack, but also in anticipation of an "imminent" attack
 53) Despite the arguments of somewell-known international law scholars to the contrary, every state has, in the words of Secretary of State Elihu Root, "the right 
.. to protect itself bypreventing a condition of affairs in which it ,will be too late to protect itself
" 54) The United States need not wait until an al Qaeda attack hasoccurred before it can launch a missile against a terrorist camp or send a special operations team to take out a terrorist leader
Imminence is not a purely temporal concept
 The concept traces itsorigins to the 1837 Caroline affair, in which British forces pursued Canadian insurgents into American territory, destroyed a vessel, and killed dozens of U
S. citizens.ss) After that incident, the United States and Great Britainagreed in 1841 that a pre-emptive attack was justified if the "necessity of self-defense [was] instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation
"56) Imminence classically depended on timing.Only when an attack is soon to occur, and thus certain, can a nation use force in pre-emptive self-defense
 What about the magnitude of harmposed by a threatened attack? According to conventional doctrine, a nation must wait until an attack is imminent before using force, whether the attack is launched by a small band of cross-border rebels, as in the Caroline affair, or by a terrorist organization armed with biological or chemical weapons
Terrorist groups today can launch a sudden attack with weapons of devastating magnitude
 To save lives, it is now necessary to use forceearlier and more selectively
Imminence as a concept also fails to deal with covert activity
 Terroristsdeliberately disguise themselves as civilians
 Their organizations have no
 territory or populations to defend, and they attack by surprise. This makesit virtually impossible to use force in self-defense once an attack is "imminent
" There is no target to attack in the form of the army of a nationstate.The best defense will be available only during a small window of opportunity when terrorist leaders become visible to the military or intelligence agencies
 This can occur, as in the case of bin Laden, well beforea major terrorist attack occurs
 Imminence doctrine does not address casesin which an attack is likely to happen, but its timing is unpredictable
 Rulesof self-defense need to adapt to the current terrorist threat
In addition to imminence, we need to account for the degree of expected harm, a function of the probability of attack times, the estimated casualties, and damage
 There is ample justification for factoring this in, just as itought to be a factor in ordinary acts of self-defense, as when one is attacked with a gun, as opposed to a set of fists
 At the time of the Caroline decisionin the early nineteenth century, the main weapons of war were single-shot weapons and artillery, cavalry, and infantry
 There was an inherenttechnological limit on the destructiveness of armed conflict
The speed and severity possible today means that the right to preempt today should be greater than in the past
 Weapons of mass destruction haveincreased the potential harm caused by a single terrorist attack from hundreds or thousands of innocent lives to hundreds of thousands, or even millions
 This is not even counting the profound, long-term destruction ofcities or contamination of the environment and the resulting long-term death or disease for large segments of the civilian population
 WMDs cantoday be delivered with ease- a suicide bomber could detonate a "dirty bomb" using a truck or spread a biological agent with a small airplane
These threats are difficult to detect, as no broad mobilization and deployment of regular armed forces will be visible
 Probability, magnitude,and timing are relevant factors that must be considered in determining when to use force against the enemy
This same logic explains why most applauded President John F
Kennedy's decision to blockade Cuba during the 1962 missile crisis with the Soviet Union
57J President Kennedy did not wait until the Soviet missiles inCuba were on the launching pad and being fueled for flight
 Rather, heacted earlier, during a brief window of opportunity, to head off the threat before the Soviet missiles could become operational
 58) In doing so he risked In war, the enemy includes foot soldiers and a command-and-control structure that extends up to the commander-in-chief
 Also included arepersonnel and assets not directly engaged in hostilities, such as combat and combat support units, administration, communications, logistical personnel, and suppliers
 Anyone who is a legitimate military target can beattacked with a variety of means
 "All are lawful means for attacking theenemy," wrote W
 Hays Park, one of America's most respected authoritieson the laws of war
60) "The choice of one vis-a-vis another has no bearing onthe legality of the attack
 If the person attacked is a combatant, the use of aparticular lawful means for attack (as opposed to another) cannot make an otherwise lawful attack either unlawful or an assassination
"61) Those same rules govern American attacks upon al Qaeda leaders and planners today
It makes little legal sense for the United States to have the discretion to attempt to attack Qadhafi in response to Libya's terrorism, but to refrain from doing so against bin Laden or Zawahiri
This is not to say that American agents have a hunting license for anyone suspected of being an al Qaeda operative
 The rules of warfare,which give nations and their military the right to use deadly force to defeat an enemy, impose guidelines
 These rules are not abstract, sterile, orrestrictive, nor are they broken when a missile goes astray or nearby civilians lose their lives
 The laws of war take into account that war is not aprecise science and that unanticipated harms or loss of life ancillary to a military attack will occur
A corollary of the right to kill enemy personnel and destroy assets is that the deaths of civilians that occur as a result of legitimate attacks against military targets are not illegal
 This is the source of the idea of "collateraldamage," which made its controversial appearance in the Vietnam War
But the rule is as old as war itself
 The central principle of the laws of war isthat innocent civilians should not be targeted
 On the other hand, the rulesof war accept the death of civilians in or near legitimate military targets
62)Law recognizes that war does not yet amount to antiseptic surgery where we can zap cancers with lasers but leave healthy tissue nearby unharmed
Thus, the United States does not commit murder if it bombs a location that contains both bin Laden and his associates, on the one hand, and their family members on the other
 It does not commit murder in Iraq when, inthe course of a firefight with Uday and Qusay Hussein, who were holed up in a residential building in the middle of a densely populated city, civilians living next-door are harmed
 Rather, it is the terrorists who violate the rulesof war by deliberately hiding themselves and their bases of operation within civilian populations, thereby drawing unwilling and unsuspecting innocents into the fighting
 In another example of asymmetric tactics,terrorists multiply their strength by relying on the humanitarian morals of the West not to harm civilians
 Terrorists know, depend, and capitalize onthe fact that American military and civilian leaders are reluctant to launch attacks that might generate large numbers of civilian casualties
Killing or disabling enemy personnel is of course what warfare is all about, but that does not mean that anything goes
 The United States cannotuse poison on terrorist leaders, or refuse to accept surrender, or shoot the wounded
 One of the early laws of war treaties, known as the 1907 HagueRegulations, prohibits "kill[ing] or wound[ing] treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army," as well as killing or wounding an enemy who is helpless or has surrendered, or declaring "that no quarter will be given
"63) The U.S. military interprets this provision as "prohibitingassassination, proscription, or outlawry of an enemy, or putting a price upon an enemy's head, as well as offering a reward for an enemy 'dead or alive
"' 64) Assassination, which is equated with killing the enemy usingtreachery, is prohibited
Banning "treachery" does not prohibit targeting individual enemy soldiers or commanders
 This distinction was drawn in the very first effortto codify the rules of war, undertaken by Francis Lieber during the Civil War, and issued as General Orders Number 100 in 1863 to the Union armies
65) Under the laws of war, "treacherously" refers to deceiving the enemy by disguising one's forces in the form of a noncombatant (and therefore protected from attack) or declaring an enemy outside the protection of the laws of war
66) It could also include soldiers disguisingAl Qaeda will never follow the rules of war
 Al Qaeda gains its onlytactical advantages by systematically flouting them
 American restraint inthe use of force, the methods of attack, or the treatment of prisoners does not affect the incentives of al Qaeda members, who seek a goal of salvation in the afterlife
 Suicide bombers are not susceptible to deterrence. However,al Qaeda's utterly lawless nature does not free the United States from all constraints
 Standard principles of reciprocity counsel that the United Statesfollow customary rules on targeting and the use of force
 But there is alsoample historical and legal precedent for American policymakers to address creatively the unique threat that al Qaeda poses
 There could be some areasin which rules of conduct could be negotiated- terrorist groups in the United Kingdom-IRA and the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts have successfully engaged in prisoner exchanges
 But for al Qaeda to agree to play on a levelplaying field with the United States would be tantamount to its accepting defeat
 Instead, the United States will have to draw on some old concepts,such as those used to confront piracy, and marry them to new ones, such as precision targeting through intelligence and technology
In November 2015, reacting to the massacre of more than hundred of innocent victims perpetrated an hour earlier in various Paris's venues, French President, Franc;:ois Hollande, declared «This is war»
 His commentexpressed French people's distress and anger caused by the unparalleled scope of the terrorist attacks, it did not accurately describe, however, the nature of the French State's tactics against terrorism
 France along with itsEuropean neighbors that fell victims to similar terrorist attacks did not declare war on terror on its national territory
75J Its military contribution tothe fight against ISIS in Irak and in Syria finds no equivalent at home in the conception and implementation of counter terrorism policies
 For the mostpart, European states' responses to this new threat consist in integrating existing criminal law provisions with expanded investigative procedures
The legal distinction between armed engagement and the criminal prosecution of terrorist acts committed on national territory has delimited the range of available options in the European democracies' fight against terrorism
76l Public opinion and governments alike often outline the legaland political consequences of this dichotomy that challenges the constitutional principles governing civil society and its institutions
77J Theyinterpret its mandate as preventing any form of public intervention outside the limits fixed by their respective legal systems
 But this interpretationbarely addresses the hybrid nature of Al Quaeda and Isis terrorist networks that combine international and domestic strategies with war like actions by the citizen against their own countrymen
 The most recent attacks in Franceand Belgium were planned and funded by Isis but executed with the active support and contribution of European nationals
 This challenge forces thestates to reconsider their past anti terrorist strategies and ponder complex legal and political choices
78J It requires the elaboration of adequate andeffective responses to the terrorist menace that differs from the acts of domestic terrorism that defined the political environment of the past 50 years
 79)The threat to the political and legal stability of European democracies is compounded by the cultural and social consequences of a fractured civil society
 The terrorists' self proclaimed ethnic and religious identity exposesthe social fractures of national communities and the breakdown of the multiculturalist model in secular societies
 France's recent failed attempt todeprive French nationals who perpetrated terrorist attacks of their citizenship created an intense political debate80J even if such measure was more symbolic than effective in a counter terrorist strategy
 Notwithstandingthis French political fiasco, the German government is considering to introduce a similar measure that would deprive dual citizen who are fighting in a terrorist organization abroad of their German citizenship
81)The significance of the apparent social and cultural fractures is amplified by the terrorist's self-justification and religious radicalism that opposes the values of the secular and democratic tradition and the respective autonomy of the religious and political domains
82) In this regard as Rene Girardobserved "the religious problem is the most radical one in that it goes beyond the ideological divides International terrorism presents an unprecedented constitutional challenge for the European states to balance their duty to ensure the security of their citizens with constitutionally protected civil liberties
84l Thelegitimacy of the Nation-State was built in part on its ability to provide a safe environment for its citizen
 The extension of the Rule of Law doctrineto the definition of the European Welfare State underlined the essential significance of security for the functioning of democratic institutions
"Security" the French lawmaker declared in 1995 "is a fundamental right
 Itis a condition for the free exercise of liberties and of the reduction of inequalities
 The state has the duty to provide security while ensuring, overthe whole territory of the Republic, the defense of its institutions and national interests, the respect of laws, the maintenance of peace and public order, and the protection of people and goods
"85l Likewise the Britishgovernment stated that: "The primary responsibility of any government must be to ensure the safety of its citizens
 This must inclu~e looking atwhat powers the law enforcement agencies may need in future instead of waiting until current powers have been proved inadequate in an area as significant as national security
"86) The random violence of unpredictableattacks on the State's citizens prompted European governments and citizens to assess the nature and extent of this public duty as the tragedies of the past two decades have shown the limitations of democracies' responses against terrorism The Madrid attack on 11 March 2004, killing almost 200 people and injuring many others led to the adoption of Organic Law 4/2005 that took into account new forms of terrorism and the threat of terrorist bombing
Italy updated its anti terrorism and anti mafia laws passed in the 1970's with new provisions that were eventually finalized in April 2015
 Inresponse to the European council's 2002 decision94 ) a decree-law from October 2001 adopted "urgent provisions to counteract international terrorism" and prosecute "Anyone promoting, establishing, organizing, directing or financing associations aimed at committing acts of violence with the purpose of terrorism or subversion of democracy
In the UK, the 2000 terrorism Act was amended by the Anti Terrorism, Crime and Security Act that was amended and expanded by successive Acts90l The London bombings in 2005 added a new sense of urgency and prompted a legislative impulse to strengthen the existing legal provisions
91lGermany extended its counter-terrorism provisions beyond the limits of criminal law by adopting two Anti Terror platforms at the end of 2001
 92)Article 4a of the Federal Criminal Code affirmed the jurisdiction of the federal authorities in the prevention of international terrorist "offenses The recent approval by the Italian Senate in April 2015 of the new "antiterrorism decree" introduced several legal measures specifically aimed at combatting international terrorism
 The new provisions depart from themore traditional amendment to the Criminal Code in relation to terrorist offenses given "the extraordinary necessity 'to adopt urgent measures, including punitive nature, in order to prevent recruitment into terrorist organizations and carrying out terrorist acts, strengthening altresi 'the attivita' of Information System for the Security of the Republic
"97J Belgiumupdated its 1998 anti terrorism legislation98 ) in 2003 with new provisions inserted in its criminal code99) that were further expanded after the deadly attacks in Brussels in March 2016
100) Additionally, Belgium, France andItaly101l implemented a public security plan that includes the use of the armed forces not only in ensuring the security of strategic sites but also in assisting the law enforcement agencies with public security
 The measures"Sentinelle" in France and "vigilant guardian" in Belgium reflect however the ambiguous use of the army in areas that fall traditionally under the jurisdiction of the law enforcement agencies
 The reassuring presence ofarmed soldiers in the cities' street should not distract from the fact that in Wes tern democracies the primary mission of the armed forces is not to safeguard domestic public security but to engage enemy forces outside the national territory
 Their operational structure, rules of engagement andchain of command are defined by this primary mission and their human and budgetary resources are not adapted to police operations that require different types of on site presence and skills for which soldiers are not trained
102l The short term psychological benefit of a military presence inaddressing the fears of a population traumatized by the barbarous violence of terrorist murderers should be carefully weighted against the actual risk for these countries of significantly undermining the strength and the capacity of their military power
Prior to 2001, anti-terrorist legislation mainly dealt with domestic terrorism
 This past experience served as the basis for the development ofthe new policies
 For instance, Germany's response to terrorism based on itsexperience in combatting the attacks and wave of assassinations perpetrated by the "Rote Armee Fraktion" of the Baader group shaped its criminal law
 Likewise, in 1986, France's first anti-terror law defined terrorism as "any individual or collective action that severely disturbs the public order through intimidation or terror
"103l The government's fight against ETA's armed struggle defined Spain's initial legal response to terrorism.104) The recent declaration of the Spanish lawmakers, in March 2015, introduced the new counter terrorist statute in these terms: "The experience of the struggle against terrorism has given us the possibility to rely upon a penal legislation that is efficient against acts of terrorism perpetrated by organized groups such as ETA or the GRAPO, these are well structured terrorists groups that are structured around one or more leaders, with a clear organic structure and repartition of distinct roles in the organization and with clear hierarchical relationship that are defined and observed by the members of the terrorist group.Terrorists are defined as "those belonging, acting in the service of or collaborating with armed groups, organizations or groups whose objective is to subvert the constitutional order or seriously alter public peace
"106)A comparative review of current legislation in the European countries that are the victims of terrorism reveals similar legislative patterns in the conception and implementation of legal measures for the prevention and the repression of terrorist acts
 These similitudes reflect not only the states' common penal philosophy but express also shared political values that govern the public authorities' preference for relying upon existing criminal law provisions and procedure while considering terrorism a domestic threat.The greater part of anti-terror legal measures is grouped in the Criminal Codes and Criminal Procedure Codes in the European countries that are part of the civil law tradition
107J This choice results from the combination of political, legal, institutional and social factors that influenced the governments' decision-making process.First, Democratic justifications put aside, the decision to consider terrorism as a domestic threat and to remain within the legal framework of the existing legislation is an expedient that reduces the risks of political crisis
From the ruling party's standpoint it presents the advantage of preempting unrest in the legislature and limiting the constitutional challenges that might undermine the cooperation of the players on the political chessboard
 Secondly, the decision not to deviate from the domestic approach tends to favor institutional continuity over the creation of new administrative structures that would be more adapted to the fight against international terrorism. This administrative conservatism relies upon the existing divisions that delimit the area of competence between the diverse jurisdictions of police and public security forces that are often protective of their own prerogatives. The institutional continuity benefits also from the implementation of legal procedures that result from the structure of the jurisdictional order. Thirdly, resorting to penal rules respects the overall consistency of the legal system without creating a concurrent system of rules that would create an extraordinary procedure under a state of exception. Finally from the society's perspective, there are reasons to believe that the existing legislation that is often the result of a political compromise, would be more protective of civil liberties than any type of exceptional measures that could undermine the social fabric of pluralist communities.However, the politically expedient choice to apply measures initially developed to combat domestic terrorism produces also diverse undesirable consequences
 On one hand, at the international level, it hampers the States' transnational cooperation as it upholds the fiction that terrorist attacks are a domestic and not an international problem. In doing so, it promotes a nationalist approach that encourages isolationism in the false belief that The terrorist attacks in Brussels in March 2016 and the use of this country as a base for terrorists units planning attacks in France or elsewhere fostered a renewed sense of urgency in amending the Belgium penal procedure code in order to address these new threats in a country which was until now ill equipped to deal effectively with transnational terrorism.The recent decision to modify the rule regulating home searches and to allow them during the night between 9:00 pm and 5:00 am reflects the government and the public opinion awareness of the terrorist threat
It repelled the former interdiction of night searches (between 9:00 pm and 5:00 am) that presumably prevented the Belgian police from apprehending the surviving member of the terrorist group responsible for the deadly Paris attacks in November 2015
113) Italy's decree-law and the law of conversion of 15 December 2001 streamlined bureaucratic procedures and expanded the searches to entire buildings or blocks of buildings when there is reason to believe that they might harbor terrorist suspects.114) Germany residential searches in the absence of owner's consent are authorized by article 104 of the code of criminal procedureIn France, preventive detention was first prolonged to 4 days by the statute on daily security in 2001 and 6 days in 2006 "when there exist a serious risk of imminent terrorist action in France or abroad and that the necessity of international cooperation requires it imperatively
measure has been rarely used since 2006 but the necessity to protect effectively the public from the growing threat of coordinated attacks by several terrorist units operating in concert requires better capacity to disrupt their logistics and support among radicalized religious groups
 We observe a similar trend in the increase of the period of detention in police custody of terrorist suspects in other European countries. It might be extended up to 4 days in Italy while in Spain the police may detain a suspect for up to five days without bringing him before a judge who might decide to extend the period up to 13 days. In Belgium, the proposition of the government to increase the period of police detention from 2 days to 3 days has generated as intense political debate.The extension of investigative powers is often complemented with restrictions on freedom of movements of suspected terrorists
These measures are essential in dealing with criminals who are able to exploit the weaknesses of the international security systems in a Europe without borders
The abolition of border and passport control in the Schengen area that comprises twenty-six European countries makes it difficult if not impossible to control the travels and traffics of terrorist groups
The European Union's decision to enforce the right of freedom of movement in a common market significantly undermines any attempts at developing a concerted European solution to this de facto impunity
 The apparent facility of entry and re-entry of Isis terrorist cells in Europe during the past year clearly shows the limits of the current European practice. Porous or inexistent borders between EU member states seem to work mostly to the benefit of the terrorists and not to the benefit of state security agencies that are still constrained by the multiple bureaucratic and structural hurdles that impair transnational cooperation. The large influx of political and religious refugees from the war zones in the Middle East and the resulting displacement of entire local communities further complicate a situation that is only partially controlled by the welcoming countries.Germany, France and Italy are facing a profound migrant crisis that poses a significant challenge to their asylum's rules and to the homogeneity and stability of their civil society
 The conflict between European ideals and the permanence of the international terrorist threat generates much alarm in the European public opinion. Several EU member states are rethinking their open borders policy that allows terrorists and criminal alike to evade the control of poorly coordinated national security agencies. The unexpected success of the pro-Brexit vote in the United Kingdom energized Euroskeptic movements in several countries as it expressed the people's doubts about the economic and cultural viability of the European Union model without borders which is unable to ensure the safety of its populations. The failure to monitor transnational movements of terrorism suspects underscores the necessity for European states to keep a better control on the movements of their own radicalized citizen who maintain contacts with ISIS and Al Qaeda operatives abroad. The expected defeat of ISIS and loss of its territory in Syria and Irak raise the threat of a return of ISIS fighter to European countries and social networks that would welcome and harbor them. The recent dismantling of dormant cells in Spain, France and Germany underscores the imminence of threats and the imperative necessity to increase the resources and legal tools that should provide the security agencies with better options in identifying returning terrorist fighters.British public authorities implemented restrictions on freedom of movements of suspected terrorists that were introduced by control orders during the years of the conflict in Northern Ireland
 The Prevention ofTerrorism Act (2005) implemented Control Orders that imposed various restrictions on free movement
 The legal challenges brought against this procedure led to their gradual replacement in 2011 with the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPIM) that are more adapted to the legal requirement imposed by the respect of the rule of law. TPIM may be decided by the Secretary of State with the control of the judiciary in cases of terrorism related activity for the protecting the public and the prevention of further activities in the activity. They comprise diverse options including House detention, Electronic Tagging, Assigned Residence and Forced Relocations. Restrictions on travel within or outside the UK may also be imposed.In France, the lawn° 2014-1353 from 13 November 2014 established a procedure for the interdiction to leave the national territory
Article 224-1 of the Code of Interior security states that any French citizen may be prevented from leaving the French territory if there are serious reasons to believe that he is "moving abroad in order to take part in terrorist actions
"119l This interdiction to leave the French territory is valid for six month and requires the confiscation of the passport. It may be prolonged for justified reasons. Violation of the interdiction is punished by a three years imprisonment.We can find similar provisions in the article 4 of the recent Decree-Law from 18 February 2015 promulgated in Italy
120l This new legislation introduces "urgent measures to combat terrorism, even in its international form," and to promote international cooperation for "the consolidation of peace and stability."121) In that same year, the German lawmakers added additional anti-terrorism legislation122l to limit the movements of radicalized individuals who attempt to travel outside the country "with the intent to receive terrorist training."123) It also imposed more restrictions on the use of a passport or ID card for nationals and foreigners.The effective physical control of the moveme;nts of terrorists and radicalized individuals may still be difficult to achieve
 That it shouldremain a priority in preventing terrorist attacks does not conceal the fact that the movement of persons is only but one aspect of the terrorist groups' capability to plan and carry on new attacks
 Their ability to use the internet and its technology is a fundamental part of their strategy.124) The interception of information and the disruption of their communication networks is an essential investigative tool for countering the terrorismthreat
 Reconciling the extension of this form of intelligence gathering with the principles of criminal procedure has become one of main concerns forEuropean countries and the international community
 The transnational nature of online terrorist activity requires increased cooperation between the EU member states. But successful counter terrorist strategy should still rely upon each countries' readiness to develop its technological capacity and the legal tools that will facilitate its use. Therefore computer surveillance and the use of intercept evidence complete the set of investigative measures that are indispensable to protect the public against terrorist threats.The UK long established ban on the use of intercept evidence in court has proven to be a serious hindrance in the successful prosecution of terrorist groups which rely successfully on the internet and the social medias to coordinate their attacks and persuade local "lone wolves" to commit deadly onslaughts
 The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act in 2000 authorized the interception of all forms of communications by security and intelligence agencies obtained under a warrant of the Secretary of State.For the past 15 years, following the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US, European countries have developed a more comprehensive set of legal measures against international terrorism
 Most of these measures came initially from past legislations developed in response to existing domesticterrorist threats that had little in common with the type of onslaughts that have been conducted by radicalized Islamist terrorists
 Despite increased levels of alertness and preparation, the most recent tragedies in France and in Belgium have shown the limits of the existing measures in preventing deadly attacks and neutralizing radicalized "lone wolves" who maintain close internet connections with terrorist handlers based abroad. The European States' awareness of the unique nature and scope of these threats is not yet reflected in their counter terrorist strategies as can be seen from the difficulties to implement effective security measures that are compatible with constitutional principles.145l The historical commitment to the fundamental values of the democratic society should not distract from the necessity to rethink the alleged opposition between public security and civil rights that was fundamental in the context of domestic terrorism but that shows its limits against the hybrid form of terrorism that blends transnational configuration with national execution.
