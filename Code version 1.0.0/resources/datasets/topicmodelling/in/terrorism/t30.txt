 This can occur, as in the case of bin Laden, well beforea major terrorist attack occurs
 Imminence doctrine does not address casesin which an attack is likely to happen, but its timing is unpredictable
 Rulesof self-defense need to adapt to the current terrorist threat
In addition to imminence, we need to account for the degree of expected harm, a function of the probability of attack times, the estimated casualties, and damage
 There is ample justification for factoring this in, just as itought to be a factor in ordinary acts of self-defense, as when one is attacked with a gun, as opposed to a set of fists
 At the time of the Caroline decisionin the early nineteenth century, the main weapons of war were single-shot weapons and artillery, cavalry, and infantry
 There was an inherenttechnological limit on the destructiveness of armed conflict
The speed and severity possible today means that the right to preempt today should be greater than in the past
 Weapons of mass destruction haveincreased the potential harm caused by a single terrorist attack from hundreds or thousands of innocent lives to hundreds of thousands, or even millions
 This is not even counting the profound, long-term destruction ofcities or contamination of the environment and the resulting long-term death or disease for large segments of the civilian population
