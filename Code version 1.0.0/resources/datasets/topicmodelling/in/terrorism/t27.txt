 In domestic law enforcement,which is governed by tougher standards, a police officer who fires his weapon on the reasonable belief that his attacker holds a gun is not punished by law, even if it turns out that his belief was in error
 We ask thatour soldiers make reasonable decisions when they choose their targets and decide how much force to use
 Similarly, our policymakers consider all ofthese factors when they decide whether to use deadly force against a suspected al Qaeda member
 They must balance matters like the effect of anattack on allied governments, local populations, and nearby civilians against the benefit of eliminating an al Qaeda leader and frustrating the plans he might have been organizing, while also keeping in mind the probability of success in the attack
Killing an individual, of course, is not legal in all circumstances
 Nor is itillegal in all circumstances
 Killing an individual can be legal when it iscarried out by the state as criminal punishment of a convicted first-degree murder by a capital jury
 It can be legal when a police officer shoots anattacker armed with a weapon
 It can be illegal when it is murder, as withany of the thousands of premeditated murders that occur in the United States every year
 It is illegal when it is "assassination." But killing theenemy in wartime is legal
