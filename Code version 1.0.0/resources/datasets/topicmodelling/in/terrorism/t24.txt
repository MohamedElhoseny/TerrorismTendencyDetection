 In terms ofthe Internet, hubs are highly trafficked websites with connections to many other sites, such as Google
com, Yahoo.com, and MSN.com. Users visitthem often in order to connect to other sites, and a great many other sites connect to them as well
 In a social or professional network, hubs arepeople that are widely known, who set trends or whose work influences a great many others
Decentralization is another attribute
 Because of decentralization, anetwork can quickly collect and process information from a myriad of sources located in different places and connected only by a common interest or affinity
 If a node disappears, others simply move their connections.Networks can remain remarkably immune to attack
 Randomlydestroying its nodes will not cause it to collapse, and the loss of a single hub will not bring down the whole network
 Therefore, because it has noreal single leader, it can function even after suffering severe losses
Al Qaeda is just such a network
