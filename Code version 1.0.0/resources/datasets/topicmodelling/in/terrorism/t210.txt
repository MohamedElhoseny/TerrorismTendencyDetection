 HUCKABEE: I think Rick Santorum is exactly right. You take away their land. But one of the things we have to do is a comprehensive strategy to get ISIS. First of all, take away their access to social media platforms. The second thing, go after them financially. Any company, any country, that even gets close to dealing with them, absolutely put sanctions on them. Make them pay. And finally, you have got to go after them militarily. We obliterate them. They are a force that's getting bigger. And with any kind of cancer, you don't contain it; you eradicate it. And that's how we have to fight ISIS, comprehensively.
