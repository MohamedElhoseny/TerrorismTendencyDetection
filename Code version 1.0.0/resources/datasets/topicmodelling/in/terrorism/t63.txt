The deliberate alteration of data and destabilization of computers and networks represents cyberterrorism's end result. Cyberterrorism also includes efforts on the part of terrorists to spread destructive propaganda against governments or groups. Cyberterrorists issue threats and calls for attacks in a similar manner to produce fear before, or in place of, taking destructive action. Cyberterrorism may also occur in conjunction with bombings or other physical attacks.
