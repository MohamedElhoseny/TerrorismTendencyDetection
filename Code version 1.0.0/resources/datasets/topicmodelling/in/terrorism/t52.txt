Democratic societies cherish, and in many cases guarantee, individual freedom without interference or restriction by the government. Civil rights include the right to life, liberty and security; the right to privacy; and the right to a fair trial and due process. Some freedoms guaranteed in the United States are freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and freedom of assembly and association. During times of war, civil liberties may be limited or even suspended, and restored again once the war is over.
