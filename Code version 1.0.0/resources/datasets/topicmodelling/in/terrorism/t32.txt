 "All are lawful means for attacking theenemy," wrote W
 Hays Park, one of America's most respected authoritieson the laws of war
60) "The choice of one vis-a-vis another has no bearing onthe legality of the attack
 If the person attacked is a combatant, the use of aparticular lawful means for attack (as opposed to another) cannot make an otherwise lawful attack either unlawful or an assassination
"61) Those same rules govern American attacks upon al Qaeda leaders and planners today
It makes little legal sense for the United States to have the discretion to attempt to attack Qadhafi in response to Libya's terrorism, but to refrain from doing so against bin Laden or Zawahiri
This is not to say that American agents have a hunting license for anyone suspected of being an al Qaeda operative
 The rules of warfare,which give nations and their military the right to use deadly force to defeat an enemy, impose guidelines
 These rules are not abstract, sterile, orrestrictive, nor are they broken when a missile goes astray or nearby civilians lose their lives
 The laws of war take into account that war is not aprecise science and that unanticipated harms or loss of life ancillary to a military attack will occur
