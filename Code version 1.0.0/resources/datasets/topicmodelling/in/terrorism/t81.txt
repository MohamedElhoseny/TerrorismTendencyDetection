The need to coordinate allies, a traditional U.S. role, is more apparent than ever. In a bit of good news, counterterrorism cooperation improved in recent years—the 2015 Paris attacks in particular proved a wakeup call for European allies, and information-sharing on suspected terrorists became far better. However, under President Obama, the United States at first neglected the Syrian conflict but then tried to build a broad coalition against the Islamic State without devising a broader policy toward the Syrian conflict as a whole. The Trump administration has magnified this confusion, with allies like Turkey and Israel increasing their involvement in Syria with little U.S. effort to manage things—indeed, the State Department, the military, and the White House all seemed to send Turkey different signals when it invaded territory in Syria controlled by U.S.-allied Kurds there. Allies can magnify U.S. power, but if the United States doesn’t try to lead them, they can make the chaos worse. Don’t Rely on Training Programs.
