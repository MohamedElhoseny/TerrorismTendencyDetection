Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill. Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers. Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year.

When ISIL does videos that say the easiest way to get a combat assault weapon in the US is at a gun show, we should all be waking up. We need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons.
