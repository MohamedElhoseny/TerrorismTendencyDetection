 This "blowback" theory [that the US actions in the Middle East led to the creation of al Qaeda and ISIL] is controversial especially among some who view all of these attacks [by terrorists on civilian targets in Europe and the US] as part of some grand design to manipulate public opinion to support the permanent war strategy being operationalized across the planet in the name of fighting terrorism. While the forces of domination can tactically take advantage of these attacks to further that agenda, the position that this is all part of a grand plan gives those forces a ubiquity and level of competence among the people making policy that the evidence of how policy is developed and executed does not support. There are already calls being made in some quarters for a more forceful intervention into Syria to crush ISIS in response to the attack in Turkey.
