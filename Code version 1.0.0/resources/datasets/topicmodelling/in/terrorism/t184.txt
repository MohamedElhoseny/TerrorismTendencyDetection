 "Make no mistake, I'm pleased that we're engaging jihadists and at least making plans to roll back ISIS's most dramatic gains, but by continuing to minimize the threat even as he escalates his military response, he is leaving the American people unprepared for the long struggle to come and leaving his successor to fight the truly big battles. Obama isn't the peace president. He's the man who squandered victory in Iraq &left a legacy of broader conflict & greater human misery. Hope and change indeed."--May 13
