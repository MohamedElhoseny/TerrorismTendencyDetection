Over the centuries, the laws and customs of war have developed to reduce the harm to noncombatants and limit the use of force to that which is proportional to military objectives
 By specifically targeting enemy leaders,the United States can render enemy forces leaderless and frustrate their operations, prevent the enemy from mounting effective plots and campaigns, and reduce both civilian and military casualties Using targeted killing as a primary tactic also takes better account of the new kind of war facing the United States
