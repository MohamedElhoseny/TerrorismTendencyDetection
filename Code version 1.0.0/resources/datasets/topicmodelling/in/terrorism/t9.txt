S.counter-terrorism today, is whether a nation can wage an international armed conflict against a non-state
there would be no question about whether a state of war would exist
 If,during the Cold War, the Soviet Union had sent KGB agents to drive airplanes through American skyscrapers, the United States would have retaliated, it would have gone on a war footing, and its mutual self-defense agreements with other countries would have been triggered
 Why shouldan energy's status as an international terrorist organization rather than a nation-state make a difference as to whether war exists? While al Qaeda was not a household word before the September 11 attacks, the United States had suffered repeated attacks at its hands
 These include the suicidebombing of the U
S.S. Cole in 2000, the bombing of American embassies inKenya and Tanzania in 1998, the attack on a U
S. military housing complexin Saudi Arabia in 1996, and the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993
 Only good intelligence and law enforcement work, helpful allies, andluck had frustrated planned attacks on American airliners over the Pacific Ocean, Los Angeles airport during the millennium, and various American embassies and personnel in Europe and Asia
Critics of the American response focus on the unconventional nature of the attacks
 The attacks bore important differences with wars of the past.The attackers wore no uniforms, carried no arms openly, and did not operate as part of regular military units
