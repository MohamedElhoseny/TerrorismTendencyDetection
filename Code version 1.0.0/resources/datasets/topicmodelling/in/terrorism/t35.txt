 Suicide bombers are not susceptible to deterrence. However,al Qaeda's utterly lawless nature does not free the United States from all constraints
 Standard principles of reciprocity counsel that the United Statesfollow customary rules on targeting and the use of force

 There could be some areasin which rules of conduct could be negotiated- terrorist groups in the United Kingdom-IRA and the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts have successfully engaged in prisoner exchanges
 But for al Qaeda to agree to play on a levelplaying field with the United States would be tantamount to its accepting defeat
