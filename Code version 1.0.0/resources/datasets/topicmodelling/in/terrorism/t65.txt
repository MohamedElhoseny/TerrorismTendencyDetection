One expert has pointed out that the security of personal, organizational, and government networks in the United States cannot be approached from a single defense standpoint. The reason for this is that the Internet is accessible from anywhere, and there exist no virtual barriers that correspond to national borders. Moreover, just as physical terrorist threats may come from within the country, so can those of cyberterrorists. This further indicates the risk of sabotage and espionage by those with both direct and non-direct access to U.S. networks.
