The discussion of civil liberties and anti-terror addresses the balance needed between protection of fundamental individual rights and the prevention of activity that places the public in harm's way. Terrorism, although difficult to define, can be most succinctly described as any criminal act meant to manipulate a public audience beyond that of its immediate victims. Depending on the viewer, it has been seen both as tactical and strategic, justified and heinous, unlawful and heroic. Regardless of the rationale, it is clear that for the victims, many of whom are indirect or innocent bystanders, terrorism results in unlawful, and often devastating, violence.
