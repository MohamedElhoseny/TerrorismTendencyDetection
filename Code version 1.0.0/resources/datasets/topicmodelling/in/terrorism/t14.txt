 But there is a line, however indistinct,between crime and war
 Crime is generally committed for personal gain orprofit rather than a larger political goal
 Drug cartels employ murder,kidnapping, robbery, and destruction to create a distribution network, grab turf from other gangs, intimidate rivals or customers, and even retaliate in military fashion against law enforcement
 Al Qaeda resembles organizedcrime like the Mafia in some respects, but the Mafia is unconcerned with ideology and is primarily out to satisfy its greed
War involves opposing political objectives
 The United States went towar in World War II to achieve regime change in Germany and Japan
 Itresorted to armed force in Korea, Vietnam, and Panama, among other places, to stop the spread of harmful ideologies or to remove corrupt regimes
 Like a nation, al Qaeda's attacks are highly organized, military innature, and are aimed at achieving ideological and political objectives
 BJCrime can certainly be involved in its fundraising efforts, such as stealing money or defrauding charities, but Al Qaeda uses this money for military and intelligence efforts rather than the mere accumulation of wealth
 Anenemy's conscious political object also distinguishes war from an emergency, which can arise from an act of God, such as Hurricane Katrina or a pandemic, or impersonal market forces, such as the Great Depression
