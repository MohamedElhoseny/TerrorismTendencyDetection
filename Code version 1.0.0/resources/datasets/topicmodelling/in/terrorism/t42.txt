120l This new legislation introduces "urgent measures to combat terrorism, even in its international form," and to promote international cooperation for "the consolidation of peace and stability."121) In that same year, the German lawmakers added additional anti-terrorism legislation122l to limit the movements of radicalized individuals who attempt to travel outside the country "with the intent to receive terrorist training."123) It also imposed more restrictions on the use of a passport or ID card for nationals and foreigners.The effective physical control of the moveme;nts of terrorists and radicalized individuals may still be difficult to achieve
 That it shouldremain a priority in preventing terrorist attacks does not conceal the fact that the movement of persons is only but one aspect of the terrorist groups' capability to plan and carry on new attacks
 Their ability to use the internet and its technology is a fundamental part of their strategy.124) The interception of information and the disruption of their communication networks is an essential investigative tool for countering the terrorismthreat
 Reconciling the extension of this form of intelligence gathering with the principles of criminal procedure has become one of main concerns forEuropean countries and the international community
 The transnational nature of online terrorist activity requires increased cooperation between the EU member states. But successful counter terrorist strategy should still rely upon each countries' readiness to develop its technological capacity and the legal tools that will facilitate its use. Therefore computer surveillance and the use of intercept evidence complete the set of investigative measures that are indispensable to protect the public against terrorist threats.The UK long established ban on the use of intercept evidence in court has proven to be a serious hindrance in the successful prosecution of terrorist groups which rely successfully on the internet and the social medias to coordinate their attacks and persuade local "lone wolves" to commit deadly onslaughts
 The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act in 2000 authorized the interception of all forms of communications by security and intelligence agencies obtained under a warrant of the Secretary of State.For the past 15 years, following the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US, European countries have developed a more comprehensive set of legal measures against international terrorism
 Most of these measures came initially from past legislations developed in response to existing domesticterrorist threats that had little in common with the type of onslaughts that have been conducted by radicalized Islamist terrorists
 Despite increased levels of alertness and preparation, the most recent tragedies in France and in Belgium have shown the limits of the existing measures in preventing deadly attacks and neutralizing radicalized "lone wolves" who maintain close internet connections with terrorist handlers based abroad. The European States' awareness of the unique nature and scope of these threats is not yet reflected in their counter terrorist strategies as can be seen from the difficulties to implement effective security measures that are compatible with constitutional principles.145l The historical commitment to the fundamental values of the democratic society should not distract from the necessity to rethink the alleged opposition between public security and civil rights that was fundamental in the context of domestic terrorism but that shows its limits against the hybrid form of terrorism that blends transnational configuration with national execution.
